小红书 。\n三瓶矿泉水塞进背包，最终只喝完一瓶，这才明白旅途的真谛：行囊越轻，脚步越自在。\n天鹅湖 踏入景区时，天光已渐亮，担心的雨也已经停了。很幸运被分配到了右线，因未至丰水期，左线景致稍逊，索性专心探索右线秘境。观光车一路向上，我径直坐到了终点站——原始森林。\n这或许是最叛逆也最正确的决定。攻略上鲜少提及这段路程，或多让人放弃这段，游客多在中途站点匆匆下车。而我独爱这条三公里的幽径：从原始森林到草海，终至天鹅湖。王安石说得好：“而世之奇伟、瑰怪，非常之观，常在于险远，而人之所罕至焉，故非有志者不能至也”。这条 3 km 的徒步路线人迹罕至，十分安静，走在涧流森林之间，别是一番享受。\n涧水在脚下叮咚，古木在头顶交叠。人迹罕至处，时间仿佛被苔藓吸收。偶尔遇见一两只松鼠抱着松果张望，又迅速消失在密林深处。天光透过树冠碎成剪影，洒在小径上。此刻才懂，所谓仙境不在打卡景点，而在脚步与自然独处的分秒之间。\n这里不同于小七孔，可以在水中嬉戏游玩，凡是靠岸都有着“禁止玩水”的标识，为九寨沟平添了几分神秘。\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e 我向来不喜出片，我喜欢用眼睛记录一切，用回忆凝固时光。镜头太硬，框不住流水的柔软；像素再高，也留不下风拂过树梢的簌响。\n我选择多看几眼——让孔雀蓝的湖水在视网膜上多停留一会儿，让远山倒映的波纹在记忆里多荡漾几秒。然后闭上眼，把这一切压成心底的底片，映在大脑褶皱处。 那些随意按下的快门，没有构图的讲究，没有调色的矫饰，只是笨拙地证明：我来过，我记得。\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e 我选择蹲下来，看一丛野蕨如何在石缝里蜷曲新生。这种收藏不需要内存卡，它会在某个冬夜的梦里，突然浮现出一抹湿润的碧绿。\n九寨沟的美，何必装进相册？\n它早已在我不设防的凝视中，完成了最温柔的显影。\n海子 一路走过许多海子，它们像散落的翡翠，被山神随手抛在这条山谷里。光线流转，角度稍移，每一片水域便显出不同的脾性——有的蓝得矜持，有的绿得天真，有的在阴影里沉静如墨。\n海子之间的距离并不远，我便避开景区的直通车，用双脚赶往一个又一个海子。那些铁皮匣子载着喧嚷的人群，呼啸着掠过风景，像急着赶赴下一场打卡仪式。我宁愿踽行于栈道，踩着吱呀作响的木板，听自己的脚步声与鸟鸣相互应答。人少的地方，连水色都显得更清澈些。\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e 行至中线时，天忽然变了脸色。细雨悄然而至，不是倾盆，只是疏疏落落的，像谁在高处筛着一把银珠子。犀牛海的水面被雨点击出无数细小的酒窝，老虎海则腾起一层青烟，而火花海——多么矛盾的名字——此刻非但没有火花，反而像一块被雨丝反复擦拭的毛玻璃。\n最妙的是那些鱼。雨滴惊醒了水底的居民，它们倏忽聚散，在涟漪中织出瞬息万变的网。我伏在木栏上，看一尾黑鱼如何灵巧地穿过雨帘，又如何在转身时甩出一串细碎的水晶。这一刻，时间变得黏稠起来。\n雨中的九寨沟，终于褪去了明信片式的完美。它变得湿润、朦胧，甚至有些凌乱，却也因此显得格外真实——像一首被雨水洇湿的诗，字迹晕染开来，反而有了生命。\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e 瀑布 比起那些静默的海子，我更爱飞湍瀑流——爱它们撕开山涧的决绝，爱它们跌碎在岩石上的轰鸣。水若是大地的血脉，瀑布便是它最激昂的脉搏。\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e 珍珠滩瀑布像一匹失控的银缎。千万颗水珠从钙华滩上迸射而起，天光穿过水雾，竟真幻化出珍珠滚落的错觉。我坐在瀑布出发处，瀑布从我脚下经过。水量虽不大，却忽然懂得何为“大珠小珠落玉盘”——白居易当年听的不过是琵琶，而此刻，是整座山峦在弹奏。\n转到诺日朗瀑布，气势陡然磅礴。这瀑布确如披发怒吼的巨人。水流从270米的宽度纵身跃下，坠成一道雪白的弧光。最奇妙的是瀑底那些古树，根系裸露在激流中，却年年抽出新枝，像一群倔强的舞者踩着浪头即兴摇摆。\n最意外的惊喜是树正瀑布。它藏在寨子与寨子之间，水声引路。层层叠叠的梯瀑从灌木丛里钻出来，像一群嬉闹的孩子，前一秒还躲在树后咯咯笑，下一秒就扑进深潭哗啦啦地打滚。我坐在对面的栈道上久久不想离去，明快的节奏感黏在耳膜上，至今未褪。\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e 我想起《庄子》里的“天籁”。原来不用刻意寻找，九寨沟的瀑布早把答案摔碎在每一朵浪花里：所谓天籁，不过是水在自由时，发出的笑声。\n归途 当坐着观光车驶离景区，我回头望了一眼渐暗的山谷。九寨沟的轮廓在暮色中慢慢模糊，像一页被晚风轻轻合上的童话书。那些蓝得让人心颤的海子、在雨中跃动的鱼群、以及瀑布永不疲倦的轰鸣声，此刻都成了记忆里闪烁的碎片。\n回程的高铁上，我翻看手机里照片——没有精修，没有滤镜，甚至有些模糊。可奇怪的是，每张照片都能让我想起当时的温度、气味，以及心跳的节奏。原来真正的风景从来不会被镜头束缚，它只会悄悄钻进你的感官，在某个不经意的瞬间突然苏醒。\n或许正如小学课本上写的那样，九寨沟的确是人间仙境。但此刻我才明白，仙境的魔力不在于它有多完美，而在于它让你心甘情愿地交出自己的眼睛、耳朵，和所有清醒的感官。然后，在往后的岁月里，一遍又一遍地重返那片被山水吻过的记忆。\n费用 交通费用 C5746 成都东→松潘 ￥97 C5814 黄龙九寨→成都东 ￥106 松潘高铁站→九寨沟景区 ￥56 九寨沟景区→黄龙九寨高铁站 ￥60 学校→成都东站 ￥26.7（53.4/2） 地铁成都东站→牛王庙 ￥2.7 九眼桥→学校 ￥23.85（47.7/2） 共享单车 ￥1.8 总计 ￥374.05 门票 学生优惠套票 ￥185 食物 零食有鸣 ￥37.53 香蕉 ￥7.5 蓝莓 ￥10 樱桃 ￥20 粽子 ￥10 烧烤 ￥55 总计 140.03 装备 雨衣 ￥5.5 合计 ￥704.58 ","date":"2025-06-02T21:00:52+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%88%9D%E5%A4%8F%E8%BD%BB%E6%9F%93%E4%B9%9D%E5%AF%A8%E6%B2%9F%E4%B8%87%E9%A1%B7%E7%90%89%E7%92%83%E6%98%A0%E7%BF%A0%E5%BE%AE/title_hu_66bfb6e437d3e930.png","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%88%9D%E5%A4%8F%E8%BD%BB%E6%9F%93%E4%B9%9D%E5%AF%A8%E6%B2%9F%E4%B8%87%E9%A1%B7%E7%90%89%E7%92%83%E6%98%A0%E7%BF%A0%E5%BE%AE/","title":"初夏轻染九寨沟，万顷琉璃映翠微"},{"content":"脱束身衣：溯源父权性文化对女体的消解 之所以要脱束身衣，正是因为广义的女性束身衣，全部都是父权制性文化的衍生产品。\n父权社会把“性快感”这种令人上瘾的激素作用和对女性身体的解构、审视严密关联，从而发展出如今的性文化，并使它的不可质疑性根植在多巴胺回路上。各种广义的“束身衣”，作为父权性文化的衍生品，也因此获得虚假却牢固的“自然性”。这种回路，可能比父权-消费主义的回路更加本质，更难打破。\n我因此也不赞成“抓大放小”之类的说法。女权脱“束身衣”，不仅仅是因为脱束身衣具体可实践且节约注意力和金钱成本，更是因为，它是对父权制性文化进行溯源的必要步骤，而父权制性文化，又是 sexism 的基石。\n父权的性文化，在束身衣上，表现为强行规定女性的某些部分为“性感器官”\n阴道和子宫不是自然意义的“性感”器官，色情作品却极尽描绘插入行为，甚至合理化女性在强奸中感受到快感；胸部不是自然意义上的“性感”器官，观察其他哺乳动物，并没有见过乳房相关的性行为，相反，它几乎只和哺乳行为联系在一起；这种“性感化”甚至蔓延到女人的头发上、小脚上、幼态上、肌肉减少上，最后，不仅仅男人，女人也纷纷歌颂“只有女人是性感的”，在这种快乐和自满中，女人完全无法追溯父权制性文化的整体压迫——阴道和子宫的性感化是为了窃取后代，胸部的性感化是为了强调哺乳职责，“脚审美”、白瘦幼审美是为了预防“逃奴”，长发性感化是阻止女人像男人一样为了生存方便而剃头。“女人比男人性感多了”，是因为男人和女人都在以父权制的性文化看待女体，肢解女体。\n人们常常赞颂人类的文化凌驾于自然界的其他物种之上，然而，我一想到其中的父权性文化，想到它带来的无厘头标签、无厘头性反应 (全靠意淫），就忍不住发笑——父权性文化下的人，仿佛在极不自然地抽搐。这种不自然不止发生在所谓“异性恋者”身上，它通过文化传播，对所有女人施加束缚。大胆地进一步说，不仅仅直女的“性欲”在受父权制洗脑，连女同的“性欲”也逃不掉男性文化的影响。甚至，我这样的所谓“无性恋者”，未经反思，也不能避免这种抽搐。\n脱束身衣“的独特性，正在于它是去性感化运动，它能实打实地减少父权强力施加在女性身体器官上的“性感”烙印。它并非是“在意男性的眼光而故意倒行逆施”，而是非常理性地对整个父权社会施加女性意志的影响。\n而诸多博主所辩护的“lo 裙反叛”“农村妇女化妆反叛”等等，并不能解除女体的“性感”烙印，相反，事实上可能会加重女人的性化。\n婚姻、代孕、男性人口过多的危险性体现在各种新闻和数据里，女人因为趋利避害而不结婚、反对代孕、呼吁停止接男宝，离女权觉醒仍有一步之遥。\n而脱束身衣，把反省父权的重任交到了每个个体的女性身上，它固然比喊口号困难，也注定受到前文所说的父权性文化回路的排斥。然而，其中来自一些女权主义者的嘲讽和遏制，还是让我非常惊讶。\n脱束身衣，是为了让女性的身体部位从父权规定的“性感器官”中解放出来，不要再让女性的身体被消解为这部分、那部分，把人格和尊严的完整性还给女性，不再做一个性感的“裂女”，一堆父权性符号的合集。\n裂女凝视 指任何破坏女性身体整体意义，肢解为一部分一部分看待的行为。包括男性凝视、女性社区四处找“瑕疵”的外貌焦虑、社会对子宫的和管束女性自己肢解自己整体意义的行为，可以称为“自裂”或“裂女”(名词)。\n\u0026ldquo;visually dismember\u0026rdquo; refers to any act that deconstructs the wholism view of female body and dismembers it into parts. It includes the male gaze, the female community\u0026rsquo;s appearance anxiety of looking for \u0026ldquo;flaws\u0026rdquo; of female body, and the society\u0026rsquo;s covet and control of the uterus. Women\u0026rsquo;s behavior of visually dismembering can be called \u0026ldquo;self

“束身衣”就是限制女性的身体达到自然、舒适、健康状态的东西，胸衣、裹脚布、不便利的女装常服、非艺术性化妆、高跟鞋、不必要的长发造型等等，都是束身衣。\njm所代表的，或许就是父权对女体的视觉肢解走向肉体肢解的过程，这里面是有联系的。 因为父权视角就是把女性的身体分开来看待，犯罪中必然很容易发展为肢解。广义地说，这也是性视角的危险性。很容易破坏人的整体意义。而评估健康，评估精神面貌，前提就永远是把一个人作为整体来评价。去性化就是回到一种健康的评价。 感觉所谓的什么“lo裙反叛”之类的，是非常浅层的，像小孩子一样你不让我干我非要干的对于特定表层行为的“撒娇式”反叛，不管也不去思考为什么要做和这样做的结果。而对于男权也不痛不痒，触碰不到根本，就像大人会把小孩子撒泼哭闹看在眼里吗？ 脱束身衣才是真正能够掀桌子，从根本上反抗这种裂女凝视的行为。而且脱束身衣多舒服多爽啊真的搞不懂她们折腾自己搞得自己挺难受还妄想能对别人造成伤害的奇怪行为。 “人”是一个完整性概念，社会永远只想抽取其部分，抽取劳动价值称为资本剥削（由男性占有生产资料的婚女劳动，我认为是一种小单元资本剥削），抽取性价值称为性剥削，抽取孕育价值称为子宫剥削。资本剥削使人丧失时间上的整体意义，性剥削和子宫剥削使女性丧失身体上的整体意义。女性站在社会资本剥削、家庭类资本剥削、性剥削、子宫剥削的中间。而身体整体意义的丧失，或许是她们遭遇肉体肢解犯罪的原因之一。 你不能跟强壮的男人生活在一起；因为，如果你要是被统治的话，你就完了；而你也不能跟软弱的男人生活在一起；因为，如果你要劳神管理他们的话，你也完了。 男人真的好爱在性幻想里残女，之前因为jm的事还了解到一个色情分支叫ryona，男人通过残害、肢解女性获得快感，让女性彻底沦为物件，彻底掌控和占有，就是权力的春药。 天乳运动 鸣谢：\n民国时期倡导“天乳运动”，严查女性束胸，发现一次罚50大洋|宣扬_网易订阅 民国是中国历史上一个充满变革的年代。面对西方思想的涌入和本土社会结构的剧变，女性的解放成为了一个重要的议题。在这种背景下，民国政府颁布了一项与女性身体自由息息相关的法律：严查妇女束胸行为，发现一次罚款50大洋……\n“天乳运动”的背景与起源 在清朝末期，束胸作为一种传统的女性穿着方式，早已深入人心。束胸的历史源远流长，可以追溯到唐宋时期。《簪花仕女图》中的仕女形象，展现了当时女性胸部的自然曲线，没有过多的束缚。\n在中国传统社会中，女性身体长期被视为男性审美与道德规范的附属品。封建礼教强调“三从四德”，要求女性以柔弱、顺从的形象示人，而束胸正是这种审美观念的具象化表现。通过束胸，女性试图塑造一种纤细、柔弱的体态，以符合社会对“淑女”的期待。\n随着时代的演变，束胸的意义又多了好几层意思。女性的身体，被要求以某种方式隐匿与保守，从而符合当时“贞洁”的定义。束胸正是礼教的一部分，用以消除女性身体的诱惑感，这何尝不是一种压迫。\n这种审美观念在明清时期尤为盛行，女性通过束胸来掩饰身体曲线，以避免被视为“不贞”或“放荡”\n辛亥革命后，社会大变革。民国政府上台后，首先推出了一系列旨在“振兴国民”的社会改革，尤其是在女性解放方面。这股现代化浪潮中，女性的身体解放成为了最引人注目的议题之一。\n“放足运动”，即摒弃女性裹脚的陋习，成为了中国现代化进程中的一项标志性变革。该运动不仅是在体力上解放了女性的双脚，也在思想上为女性的身体解放奠定了基础。\n尽管放足运动取得了一定的成果，女性的胸部却依旧被深深束缚。在外部环境逐渐现代化的背景下，女性对自己的身体依旧充满了束缚，这种现象在当时的知识分子与社会改革者中引发了广泛的讨论。\n这一现象的背后，是传统与现代观念的激烈碰撞。一方面，新文化运动的倡导者呼吁女性摆脱封建束缚，追求身体自主权；另一方面，社会大众尤其是农村地区，依然固守传统观念，认为束胸是女性“贞洁”与“端庄”的象征。这种矛盾使得束胸现象在民国初期呈现出一种复杂的局面：既有人积极倡导女性身体解放，也有人顽固坚持传统审美。\n“天乳运动”的发展与推广 束胸不仅是一种文化现象，更对女性的生理健康造成了严重的负面影响。通过使用紧身胸衣或布条束紧胸部，女性试图压制胸部的自然发育，以达到“平胸”的审美效果。\n这种做法却带来了诸多健康问题：会压迫女性的胸腔，导致呼吸困难，长期下来可能引发肺部疾病；还会影响血液循环，导致内部组织受损，增加乳腺癌的风险；还会对女性的脊柱造成压力，导致驼背或脊柱变形。\n1920年，随着民众对“女性解放”议题的广泛关注，社会各界特别是文化界的精英们开始提出，女性的身体应当摆脱对美学、文化和宗教观念的束缚。\n少数学者和改革者便指出：束胸的目的，是要通过将女性的胸部压制得平坦，来符合传统文化中对女性“阴柔”的要求，这种做法实际上是对女性身体的进一步控制，剥夺了她们最基本的自然权利。\n1921年，《民国日报》便发布了一篇关于束胸危害的文章，强调束胸不仅仅对女性的身体健康造成伤害，还使她们在心理上处于一种被迫压抑的状态。越来越多的女性开始反思，为什么她们的身体必须始终保持着一种不自然的形态？\n胡适在《新青年》上发表文章，指出束胸是对女性身体的摧残，呼吁社会尊重女性的自然美。他认为：女性身体的解放不仅是个人自由的问题，更是社会进步的重要标志。\n1927年，这场运动的高潮到来。民国政府出台了严格的法令，开始大力宣扬不再允许女性束胸的思想，并且对束胸的女性进行严厉的惩罚。若在街上发现有女性束胸，立即罚款五十大洋。\n这一举措的出台，在社会上引起了极大的反响。众多知识分子、政治人物以及社会运动者纷纷表达支持，认为这是一项勇敢的改革行动，既能解放女性身体，也能为社会进步扫清障碍。\n那些反对“天乳运动”的人士认为，女性的身体不应过于暴露，应该保持一种含蓄的美感，否则将会引发社会秩序的混乱。他们的观点也代表了当时仍然固守传统文化和礼教束缚的一部分人群。\n是在一些地方，政府虽然推行禁令，但由于受限于传统的道德标准，许多女性仍然不敢放弃束胸。某些上层女性甚至因去除束胸而遭到亲人或丈夫的强烈反对，认为这种行为不仅丧失了“淑女”的形象，还可能影响家庭的尊严。\n运动中的女性抗争与自由表达 1927年3月8日，武汉的集会上，数以万计的女性走上街头，表达她们对束胸束缚的强烈不满。这不仅是一场普通的示威活动，它充满了象征意义。\n女性们的示威游行吸引了全国的目光。在这个充满动荡与变革的时期，女性们用她们的声音和身体直接向社会发出了挑战。部分女性不再掩饰自己的身体，她们放下束胸，穿着不再压抑身体曲线的衣服。\n这场抗争并非没有代价。在当时的中国社会，尤其是在传统观念根深蒂固的地区，女性身体的解放遭遇了巨大的压力。束胸不仅仅是一个服饰问题，它背后更是几千年文化观念与社会结构的产物。女性的行为和穿着往往直接关系到家庭的荣誉和社会的评价。许多支持束胸的家庭，尤其是那些传统的家庭，认为女性的暴露与自由可能带来家庭名誉的丧失。因此，许多女性在追求自由的同时，也面临着来自家庭、社会乃至丈夫的强烈反对。即便是那些勇敢的女性，也无法避免身边人的指责与非议。\n敢于反抗束胸的女性，不仅是因为身体的束缚，更是因为她们渴望摆脱所有让她们成为附属品的束缚。许多女性身处文化与观念的夹缝中，但她们依然选择以行动来表达对自我解放的追求。\n在当时，女性的身体是社会话语权的牺牲品。无论是服饰的约束，还是对女性身体的控制，所有这些都根植于社会对女性角色的刻板印象。女性必须通过一种标准的身体形态和穿着来符合社会的期望。这种标准不仅在身体上限制了女性，也在心理上不断加深她们对自己身体的压抑与顺从。\n“天乳运动”后的反思与社会影响 “天乳运动”作为民国时期女性解放运动的重要组成部分，留下了深远的历史遗产。首先，它成功地将女性身体自主权的理念引入了公众视野，挑战了传统审美观念对女性身体的束缚。通过倡导自然美与健康，运动为女性争取身体自由提供了理论支持，也为后续的女性解放运动奠定了基础。其次，运动推动了社会对女性健康的关注。在“天乳运动”的影响下，束胸对女性生理健康的危害逐渐被公众所认识，女性健康问题开始成为社会讨论的重要议题。这种关注不仅促进了女性健康知识的普及，也为现代女性健康事业的发展提供了历史借鉴。此外，“天乳运动”还在一定程度上改变了社会对女性角色的认知。通过强调女性身体自主权，运动为女性争取了更多的社会空间与话语权，推动了性别平等的发展。这种影响不仅体现在民国时期，也为新中国成立后的女性解放运动提供了宝贵经验。在一些文化先进、思想开放的城市，女性们开始逐步摆脱传统束缚，追求身体的独立与自由。\n尽管“天乳运动”取得了显著成就，但其局限性也不容忽视。在农村地区，由于传统观念的根深蒂固，运动的推广效果十分有限。许多农村女性依然固守束胸的习惯，甚至对“天乳运动”的理念一无所知。部分地方在实施《禁止妇女束胸的提案》时，采取了简单粗暴的做法，导致民众的反感与抵触。这种执行方式不仅未能有效推动运动，反而加剧了社会矛盾。天乳运动虽然短期内未能实现完全的社会变革，但它让女性身体的“自由”成为社会关注的焦点。在一定程度上，启发了更多女性思考身体与性别平等的问题，并开始质疑长期以来由社会和文化所强加的性别规范。这一思考的种子，为随后的女权运动和社会变革奠定了思想基础。从长远来看，“天乳运动”所带来的影响不仅仅局限于女性身体的解放，它更触及了社会对于性别角色、性别权利的根本反思。\n通过这场运动，女性终于开始意识到自己的身体可以不再被他人支配，身体的自由应当由自己来掌控。这一思想的深入，将在后来的一代代女性中传承下去，成为推动社会变革的重要力量。\n我的思考 身体的革命：当“脱束身衣”成为女权主义的物质实践 “束身衣”作为一种物质性的存在，远比我们想象的更为深刻——它不仅是穿或不穿的选择题，更是父权制度在女性身体上构筑的微型权力装置。从维多利亚时代的鲸骨束腰到当代的聚拢内衣，从三寸金莲到十厘米高跟鞋，这些物质实体构成了一个精密的规训系统，将女性身体分割成“可展示”与“必须隐藏”的碎片。\n父权制对女体的“性感化”操作本质上是一种符号暴力的物化过程。当阴道被简化为性交容器、乳房被异化为情欲符号、长发被编码为性别标志时，女性身体就遭遇了彻底的符号学肢解。这种肢解不仅发生在男性凝视中，更可怕的是已经内化为女性的自我认知——我们在镜中看到的不是完整的自己，而是由“需要修饰的部位”和“待改善的缺陷”拼凑而成的“裂女”形象。\n所谓“性感”的建构本质上是权力在身体上的拓扑学。观察自然界其他哺乳动物会发现，雌性的性吸引力往往与生育周期直接相关，唯独人类女性被要求保持永续的“可性化状态”。这种非常态的性化背后，是父权制对女性身体的全时空控制——从少女时期的束胸到婚后的“妻子义务”，从职场中的妆容要求到老年时的抗衰焦虑，女性的身体永远处于被评估的状态。\n当代消费主义与父权制的合谋创造了一个吊诡的“伪解放”叙事。lo 裙被包装成“甜美反抗”，高跟鞋被美化为“权力武器”，美甲艺术被颂扬为“自我表达”。这种将束缚重新编码为解放的话语策略，实则是更为精巧的规训技术——它让女性在自以为抗争的同时，继续为美妆产业和男性凝视付费。正如福柯所言：“权力最成功的时刻，就是让被支配者主动渴望被支配的时刻。”\n“脱束身衣”运动的革命性在于它直指身体的物质性解放。当女性拒绝胸罩的钢圈、舍弃高跟鞋的坡度、剪短被性化的长发时，这些看似微小的物质实践实际上在瓦解父权制的身体政治学。每具自由呼吸的女体都是对“裂女凝视”的活体抗议，它们以物质存在本身宣告：身体不是等待被评分的考卷，而是自我完整的疆域。\n这场解放运动面临的真正困境，是父权制已经将规训内化为女性的身体感觉。许多女性会真诚地相信束身衣带来“安全感”，这种悖论正是权力运作的可怕之处——它让我们把压迫误认为自我保护。打破这种感知结构的唯一途径，就是通过实际的脱束身衣体验，重新发现身体本真的舒适与自由。\n当一位女性首次体验不穿胸罩的夏日，当她的双脚从高跟鞋解放，这些物质体验产生的认知冲击远胜于任何理论说教。身体的记忆比思想的记忆更为顽固——这正是物质性实践的力量所在。在这个意义上，脱束身衣不是女权主义的战术选择，而是必须攻克的战略高地。\n期待的未来，是每个女孩成长过程中不再需要学习“如何成为合格的身体”，而是理所当然地认为自己的身体本就完整且足够。到那时，“裂女”将只是一个历史名词，而女性的身体终将重获它们与生俱来的整体性与尊严。\n当天乳运动进入历史记忆，而女性的身体仍在各种显性与隐性的束胸中挣扎时，我们或许需要一场新的启蒙：不是对乳房的解放，而是对整个社会凝视系统的解构。只有当乳房能像手掌一样不再承载过剩的性别意义，这场始于民国的解放叙事才能真正画上句点。\n《想去nobra自由的地方生活》

想象建构的秩序塑造了我们的欲望 多数人很难接受自己的生活秩序只是虚构的想象，但事实是我们从出生就已经置身于这种想象之中，而且连我们的欲望也深受其影响。于是，个人欲望也就成为虚构秩序最强大的守护者。\n例如现代西方人最重视的那些欲望，都是建构在已经为时数百年的虚构故事上，包括浪漫主义、民族主义、资本主义以及人文主义。我们常常告诉朋友要“随心所欲”，但这里的“心”就像是个两面间谍，听从的常常是外面那些主流的虚构故事。于是“随心所欲”不过也只是结合了19世纪的浪漫主义与20世纪的消费主义，再植入我们的脑海罢了。以可口可乐公司为例，旗下雪碧的广告词就是：“相信你的直觉，顺从你的渴望。”\n甚至那些人们以为深深藏于自己内心的渴望，通常也是受了想象秩序的影响。例如，许多人都很想到国外度假。然而，这件事并没有什么自然或者明显的道理。像黑猩猩的首领可不会想要运用权力让自己到隔壁黑猩猩的领土上度个假。而像古埃及的法老王，也是把所有财富拿来建造金字塔，把自己的遗体做成木乃伊，而不会有人想要去巴比伦购物或去腓尼基滑雪。现代人之所以要花费大把银子到国外度假，正是因为他们真正相信了浪漫的消费主义神话。\n浪漫主义告诉我们，为了要尽量发挥潜力，就必须尽量累积不同的经验。必须体会不同的情感，尝试不同的关系，品尝不同的美食，还必须学会欣赏不同风格的音乐。而其中最好的一种办法，就是摆脱日常生活及工作，远离熟悉的环境，前往遥远的国度，好亲身“体验”不同的文化、气味、美食和规范。我们总会不断听到浪漫主义的神话，告诉我们“那次的经验让我眼界大开，从此整个生活都不一样了”。\n消费主义告诉我们，想要快乐，就该去买更多的产品、更多的服务。如果觉得少了什么，或者有什么不够舒服的地方，那很可能是该买些什么商品（新车、新衣服、有机食品），或买点什么服务（清洁工、心理咨询、瑜伽课）。就连每一则电视广告，也都是个小小的虚构故事，告诉你买了什么产品或服务可以让日子更好。\n鼓励多元多样的浪漫主义又与消费主义一拍即合，两者携手前行，催生了贩卖各种“体验”的市场，进而推动现代旅游产业发展。旅游业真正卖的可不是机票和饭店房间，而是旅游中的经验。所以这样说来，巴黎的重点不是城市，印度的重点也不是国家，而是它能提供的经验；之所以要买经验，是因为据说这样就能拓展我们的视野、发挥我们的潜力，并且让我们更快乐。也因此，如果有个百万富翁和太太吵架，和好的方式很可能就是带她去巴黎旅游旅游。这种做法让我们看到的并不是某种个人的欲望，而是他深深坚信着浪漫的消费主义。如果是古埃及有钱人和太太吵架，带着她去巴比伦度个假绝对不会是选项，反而可能是为她建个她梦寐以求的华丽陵墓，那才会让她心花朵朵开。\n一如古埃及精英分子，现在大多数人一生汲汲营营，也都是想盖起某种金字塔，只不过这些金字塔在不同文化里会有不同的名字、形体和规模罢了。举例来说，可能是一栋近郊的独栋透天别墅，有游泳池和大庭院，也可能是一个闪闪发光的高楼公寓，有着令人屏息的美景。但很少有人会真的去问，究竟为什么我们会开始想建这些金字塔？\n—— 尤瓦尔·赫拉利 · 《人类简史：从动物到上帝》 作者认为一个人觉得需要去旅游增加阅历，想要买什么样的东西，这种事情本身不过是根植于现代消费主义符号化和浪漫主义多元化这种虚构秩序中想象的欲望，继而因此成为了这种消费主义和浪漫主义的强力守护者，这些想法根本不是什么所谓的真正的做自己，追求个性和内心，这些和人真实的欲望并没有什么关联，对人的生活也没有什么本质改变。 欲望每一次蠢蠢欲动，想要购买一个新商品时，都会在脑海里勾勒出一副美好的画面：有了这个新家具，就可以在周末的午后，晒着太阳啜着咖啡讨论一本小说；有了这身新衣服，我就魅力四射；有了这个新设备，我从此更加努力，不久就获得了成功。然而，这件商品到达后，欣喜不过几分钟到几天，继而又陷入了无限的空虚。这种满足感持续的时间越来越短，以至于我们购买商品的间隔越来越短频率越来越高，然而生活并没有任何改变。 消费社会 参考：\nreddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/136qgkb/说句很多人不太爱听的话旅游这个概念也是消费主义的重要组成部分尤其是许多现代人的旅游方式根本就不叫旅游/ 区分与物质增长的社会 所有使我们去研究关于需求与丰盛的形而上学的（Métaphysique des Besoins et de l′Abondance）那一切，都是对消费的社会逻辑的真正分析。这种逻辑根本不是那种把财富和服务的使用价值占为己有的逻辑——不平等的丰盛逻辑，一些人拥有奇迹权，而另一部分人仅有奇迹的碎片——这不是令人满意的逻辑，这是生产与驾驭社会符号的逻辑。从这个角度上看，消费过程可以从以下两个基本方面来分析：\n1．作为建立在一个密码基础之上的明确意义和交流过程，实际消费行为能够在其中得以实现并具有应有的意义。在这里，消费是一种交流体系，而且是一种语言的同等物。能够从这个层次上论及它，靠的就是结构分析。稍后，我们将再回到这一点上来。\n2．作为社会分类和区分过程，物和符号在这里不仅作为对不同意义的区分，按顺序排列于密码之中，而且作为法定的价值排列于社会等级之上。这里，消费可能是战略分析的对象，在法定的价值（涉及其他社会含义：知识、权力、文化等）分配中，决定着其特殊的分量。\n分析的原则仍然是这样：人们从来不消费物的本身（使用价值）——人们总是把物（从广义的角度）当做能够突出你的符号，或用来让你加入视为理想的团体，或作为一个地位更高的团体的参照来摆脱本团体。\n但是，这种法定的区分过程是一种基本的社会过程，每个人都是通过它注册于社会的。它既有经验的一面也有结构的一面；一个是有意识的，另一个是无意识的；一个是伦理的（名誉地位、合法竞争和声望等级方面的道德），另一个是机构的：它是密码中的永恒性的说明文字，其中意义的规范和制约——如语言的规则和制约一样——的主体却被个体遗忘了。\n消费者把不同寻常的行为当做自由、理想和选择来体验，根本不把它视为有碍分化和对规章的服从。区分总是要同时建立起整个差别次序。这样，它一下子便成为整个社会的行为，而且不可避免地超越个体。每个个体在差别次序中都各自标明一定的点，并通过这些点的本身来构成差别次序。因此，它注定了自己只是相对地被记录在里面。每个个体都把具有差别的社会利益当做绝对的利益来体验，根本体验不到结构的限制。结构的限制会使立场变化，但差别的次序仍然存在。\n但是，起决定作用的正是这种相对性的制约。因为参照它，差别的记录就永远不会终结。而且唯有它才能阐明消费的基本特点，即它的无限（ILLIMITÉ）特点——用某种需求和满足理论无法解释的那一面。因为用热能平衡或使用价值来计算，饱和的界限肯定马上会达到。但是我们所见的显然是恰恰相反的东西：消费节奏的加速，需求的连续进攻，使得巨大的生产力和更为狂热的消费性（丰盛可以理解为匀称方程无限的减少）之间的差距拉大。这一点只有当人们彻底放弃个人满足的逻辑，并注重社会区分逻辑时才能够弄清楚。从简单的有意识的决定性中区分这种差异逻辑是必要的。因为有意识的决定仍然是满意，是积极的差异消费，而明显的符号总是既积极又消极——这使得它始终要参照其他符号，使得消费者始终不满意。\n当消费体系显然不可能自我平衡的时候，当它向前急速发展或竭力逃避现实的时候，经济学家和其他一些理想主义的思想家，对福利所表现出的惊慌是耐人寻味的。其特点是，他们的观点总是用财富和收入的增长术语来表达，从来不用关系和符号区分的术语来表达。因而热尔瓦齐说：“由于收入的提高扩大了消费的可能性，增长便伴随着新产品的持续出现而出现了”；“收入上涨的趋势不仅会带来新的财富趋势，而且会带来同一种财富质的极大提高”（为什么呢？是什么逻辑关系？）；“收入的增加会引起质量的逐步提高”。这同一种论点总是暗含着：“钱挣得越多越想要，而且是要更好的。”——这话无论形容个人还是形容所有的人都是合适的。每个人都希冀获得最为理性的享受。\n从广义上讲，消费领域对于他们来说是个清一色的领域（至多有少许的收入和“文化上的”差异）。在统计学上，它分布在一般的人：“消费者”的周围。这是由代表广大普通群众的美国社会所引发的观点。欧洲的社会学总体上也是立足于此。然而恰恰相反的是，消费领域是一个富有结构的社会领域。随着其他社会类别相对“攀升”，不仅是财富而且是需求本身，作为文化的不同特征，也都从一个模范团体、从一个起主导地位的优秀分子向其他社会类别过渡。“消费大众”是没有的，基层消费者也从不会自发地产生任何需求：只有经过“精选包装”，它才有机会出现在需求的“标准包装”之中。需求的一系列等级，与物和财富的等级一样，根据一种绝对的原则，一种保持距离和符号区分的社会等级的必要性，在社会上首先是有选择性的：需求和满足会向下渗透。这一规律，作为区别性的社会材料，决定着整个物的革新。贯穿整个消费天地的，是这种“自上而下”的具有区别性材料的更新规律，而不是反方向的（由下而上，走向完全的一致）收入的提高。\n—— 让·鲍德里亚 · 《消费社会》 我不能说所有旅客，但是很有大一部分旅客，他们在旅游的时候，并非在消费“旅行”本身这件商品，而是在把“旅行”这件事当做一件可以呈现自己的符号。\n如果我们是真的为了旅游而出行，那应该做的事情是深入到旅行的每个角落，去体验当地的生活、去感受当地人的文化、美食；但如果是把旅游视作一种符号，那旅游就会变成一场大型个人直播秀场。很多人其实并不喜欢旅游，她们只是觉得在假期的时候，自己应该找个听起来高级一些的地方待一待，并且一定要有手机信号，以便自己可以随时晒出精心修饰过的朋友圈。她们从朋友圈的点赞中，和臆想出来的亲朋好友的羡慕中所获得的快感，会大大超过从旅游这件事本身所获得的快感。\n抽象的说，她们从“旅游”这件物品中所获得的价值，没有从“旅游”这个符号中获得的价值高。如果进入了这种状态，基本就可以判断是陷入了“消费主义”的陷阱之中了。不仅旅游这件事可以用这样的逻辑去解释，那些网红奶茶、爆款鞋子，都可以用一样的逻辑去解释：当我们在消费物品本身的时候，并为入付出合理的代价时，这是正常的消费逻辑；当我们在消费物品背后的符号，并向往由无数符号所组成的“景观”，同时为之付出高额的代价时，就正在被消费主义所哄骗。\n可是更加讽刺的是，今天有许多人都在致力于构建消费主义的骗局。比如，广告、营销等行业。她们会拼命的强调自己商品的“品牌价值”，会通过各种手段让消费者付出额外的代价去购买商品，以此提高企业的整体收入，会制造千奇百怪的节日和促销活动，让人们不断的买买买，会通过广告不停的给消费者传递“买了这款车，你就有身份”“不给自己买这款包，就是对不起自己”等信号。她们不仅制造这些符号、景观来刺激消费者购买商品，甚至还会人为制造稀缺，把一件本来只值500元的商品，炒到5000元甚至50000元，来榨取最后一点消费者剩余。而这些行为最终的目的，仅仅是为了让资本更快的增殖，以获得更高的利润。当然，精明和商家和资本并不会直接告诉你这些充满铜臭味的故事，否则就没人买单了。\n为什么最近几季的复仇者联盟中，总是充斥着小蜘蛛和钢铁侠的情谊桥段。因为当人们对钢铁侠的集体崇拜，是可以换算成实打实的票房的，可是因为演员片酬、档期、观众审美疲劳等客观存在的因素导致钢铁侠不能永远存在的时候，最“经济”的做法就是通过讲故事，把钢铁侠身上所具备的符号价值，“自然而然”的传递到小蜘蛛身上。\n为什么所有的高端汽车广告，都会强调驾驶者的身份不凡，都会有意识的传递“购买我的车，你就是成功者”，也是因为这些汽车需要人们为商家所构建的符号所买单。\n最后我想说，今天没有人能够逃离得了消费主义所构建的消费社会之中，哪怕很多人知道消费主义的事实，也逃离不出去。\n唯一能做的，就是尽可能逃离那些太低级的消费主义商品，因为即便被骗也要被骗的高级一点，尤其记得躲过那些一看就是收智商税的XX奶茶、XX鞋、XX猫爪杯、XX阿姨美食。\n有人问，XX正品鞋和莆田鞋最大的区别是什么。业内人士会告诉你：外观没什么区别，区别主要在质量上。XX正品鞋穿得坏，莆田鞋不容易穿坏。\n当我们在消费物品背后的符号，并向往由无数符号所组成的“景观”，同时为之付出高额的代价时，就正在被消费主义所哄骗。 热门旅游景点和网红奶茶这类与奢侈品有些不同，这里付出的额外代价不是金钱而是排队的时间和拥挤的体验，而很多人不认为这些时间和体验属于代价。我猜这也许和高强度的舆论管制有关，缺乏高质量的文化娱乐作品使普通人的精神生活普遍空虚。 我也曾认为旅游是现代生活必不可少的一部分。但走的地方多了就会发现，现代人类社会极度同质化。不同之处很微小，比如语言与礼节。但当你走在一个旅游城市，不管是哥本哈根威尼斯还是墨西哥城纽约还是上海东京，街边都是餐饮业服务业小商铺，有些地方有流动摊贩，办公楼里进进出出都是白领打工人，退休老人坐在树荫下的藤椅上无所事事，小孩尖叫追逐嬉闹，青少年三五成群地压马路。你在这些不同族裔不同肤色的陌生人身上看见了无数个你自己你邻居你同事。毫无意义。 旅游本质上就是追逐地质运动活跃区, 看看峡谷、瀑布、冰川、险峰、洞穴，比如乌克兰, 艾奥瓦州或者河南省, 这些沃野千里的玉米小麦大平原就会觉得索然无味, 但其实挺讽刺。 这个社会现在就是虚无主义的社会，没有主流价值观，没有认知上的对错，在这个时段里，我们能做的其实也就是包容不同的想法和选择。 工业社会就是标准化的产出大量的消费品，这都是需要人买单的，最节省的方法就是推出一个符号，让所有人心甘情愿的去消费他。如果没有这个符号，人都有自己的喜好，那就没办法规模化，细分市场做不出巨头。 消费时代的朝圣者 我们拖着空心的行李箱 在机场光滑的大理石地面

世界中，而旅游正是这个时代最具迷惑性的符号消费仪式之一。这种消费行为背后隐藏着三重异化机制：\n欲望的异化：从体验到符号的降维 现代旅游已从 “体验异文化” 异化为 “收集社交货币” 的过程。我们不再为威尼斯的水巷本身出发，而是为能在 Instagram 定位打卡。这种转变印证了鲍德里亚的论断：“人们从来不消费物的本身，而是把物当做能够突出你的符号。” 当游客在卢浮宫隔着人群拍摄《蒙娜丽莎》时，他们消费的不是艺术体验，而是 “看过真迹” 这个文化资本符号。\n时间的异化：从过程到瞬间的坍缩 消费主义将旅游压缩成可量化的 “精彩瞬间”—— 朋友圈九宫格里的微笑、星级酒店早餐摆拍、景点标准照。这种时间体验的碎片化，使得本应持续数日的旅程价值，被简化为发布瞬间获得的点赞数。“满足感持续的时间越来越短”，我们陷入 “体验 - 记录 - 遗忘” 的加速循环，如同推石上山的西西弗斯，永远在追求下一个消费高潮。\n空间的异化：从地方到非场所的转化 人类学家马克・奥吉提出 “非场所”（non-place）概念——机场、连锁酒店、标准化景区这些去地域化空间。当我们在全球化的希尔顿酒店醒来，喝着星巴克咖啡，乘坐同款旅游大巴前往被商业化的 “传统村落” 时，实际上经历的是全球消费主义精心设计的空间剧场。这种体验的同质化，使得 “环游世界” 变成在不同布景前重复相同表演的行为艺术。\n消费主义的终极悖论 最吊诡的是，即便清醒认识到这套机制，仍难以逃脱。因为消费社会早已将 “反抗消费” 也纳入符号体系：购买价值 5000 元的极简主义家具、在 Airbnb 预订 “反网红” 民宿、穿着标榜 “反时尚” 的潮牌……这些看似叛逆的行为，最终都成为消费链条的新环节。\n可能的出口？ 或许真正的抵抗不在于拒绝消费，而在于重构消费的意义：\n延迟符号转化：尝试先体验后分享，甚至不分享，让体验价值回归本体。 寻找阈限空间：探索那些未被完全商业化的 “真实飞地”。 实践深度凝视：在某个场景停留足够长时间，突破符号的表层意义。 在这个全民建造消费金字塔的时代，保持对自身欲望的持续审视，或许是我们最后的自由。正如赫拉利提醒的，那些看似个人化的选择，常常只是 “结合了 19 世纪的浪漫主义与 20 世纪的消费主义” 的思维程式。解构这些程式，我们才可能短暂地，从自我构建的符号监狱中探出头来，呼吸一口真实的空气。\n当所有体验都变成可购买的套餐，当所有惊奇都按脚本发生，那个本真的、遭遇世界的“我”究竟何在？\n或许真正的朝圣，始于对这场盛大表演的自觉，始于在点赞声中听见自己灵魂的空谷回音。\n","date":"2025-05-19T22:23:08+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E6%97%85%E6%B8%B8%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%89%E6%84%8F%E4%B9%89%E5%90%97/title_hu_458ac6fa152d6d27.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E6%97%85%E6%B8%B8%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%89%E6%84%8F%E4%B9%89%E5%90%97/","title":"旅游真的有意义吗？"},{"content":"《不要坠入疲倦》

最近频频看到某些“自由主义女权”的观点被转到首页来，内容就是老一套“结婚只是个人选择”、“只要我老公人好，就不能说明我的婚姻有问题”，这种温和暖昧的态度实在看得人无力。想说一下，从我的观点出发，婚姻制度的问题到底是什么。\n人身捆绑、家务分配、家庭暴力、债务风险、婆媳矛盾……是这些吗？不是，即便这些确实是很多婚女要面临的日常。为什么不是，因为这些都是可以通过“擦亮眼找个好男人”来解决的问题。就算概率小，但只要当事人坚信自己幸运，旁人是没必要预设对方中不了彩票的。并且，这些问题的存在，并不局限于异性婚之间。所以，用这些理由论证婚姻的不合理之处，是不够站得住脚的。就好像我们没有理由因为 985 大学录取名额少、要求高，就说那不如别参加高考了一样。\n婚内生育：制度的核心矛盾 那么这个制度的问题到底在哪里？就是婚内生育。确切地说，是男女合作生育（男性凭精作父）这种模式的问题。一旦理清了这个问题，就可以明白反婚的人，到底是在反对什么。合作生育的最大问题在于，双方的付出不对等，而收获对等。（婚内生育的话，收获连对等都远谈不上，是颠倒的不对等——孩子随父姓、在文化上被视为父亲家族的后代，这个就不展开说了，冠姓权让渡带来的女性失权已经是共识了）。\n而我想说的是，就算假设我们的社会中不存在宗族这个概念，姓氏在生育环节中施加的影响为 0，不存在“女人生的孩子和男人姓吃亏\u0026quot;这个逻辑的话，合作生育，也一样是存在问题的。忽略掉其他一切影响，怀孕这个行为本身是有成本的。成本都是女性出，收获是对等的，这样到底有没有问题呢？（解释一下，什么叫收获对等，就是说假设养孩子是一件总体而言快乐大于痛苦的事情，你可以简化为养猫。合作育儿的两个人都可以享受撸猫的快乐，但是诞生这只小猫需要女方一个人付出怀胎十月的努力）\n“好男人”补偿逻辑的局限性 很显然是有问题的，一个正常的男人，应该会在这个时候感觉到有点不好意思。这时候怎么办呢？最显而易见的思路，也就是“妻权”的核心思路，就是要求男人做一个“好男人”，体谅女人的不容易。简而言之，就是要求男人在其他方面给予补偿。补偿到什么程度算完呢，就是大家都认为可以抵消女方的生育付出的时候。这思路，就是要求男人做一个“好男人”，体谅女人的不容易。简而言之，就是要求男人在其他方面给予补偿。补偿到什么程度算完呢，就是大家都认为可以抵消女方的生育付出的时候。这个时候，一个宣称自己是好男人的男人，应该也都会接受这个思路。\nOK，到这一步，我们先不谈生育价值本身是不是可衡量可物化的问题，假设它是可以物化的，并且被物化为某一个值 $N$，同时我们假设女性和男性，除了生育之外的价值（能在其他方面给对方带来的好处，简称社会价值），分别是 $X$ 和 $Y$。那么也就是说，一个对女性而言公平、对男人而言不用不好意思的婚姻，符合下面这个等式：\n$$X+N=Y$$也就是说，男性的社会价值，要等于女性的社会价值 + 生育价值，这样的婚姻，对一个想结婚的女人来说，才是真正“幸福美满”的。\n社会中的择偶逻辑隐射 这个道理，很多人就算没有等式，都懂，这就是常见的择偶思路，“A 男配 B 女，B 男配 C 女”、“高嫁低娶”、“女人要嫁一个比自己条件稍微好一点的，但是不能好太多的，是最幸福的”，无非都是在靠拢这个公式。\n这个等式里面，$N$ 值是相对恒定的，绝大多数女人都有子宫、可怀孕，但是有多少男人能保证自己在这段关系里做到 $Y-X=N$ 呢？\n当他们没有做到，也就是 $X+N\u0026gt;Y$, 那么这段婚姻里女性是吃亏的。当他们做到了，当所有人都做到了，那么这个社会是什么样子？简化一个模型，一个两千人的小社会，一千个女人，一千个男人，一对一的个体婚制，每一对都符合这个等式，也就是说，对女性集合里的任何一个人来说，都可以在男性集合里找到一个人，比她的社会价值大 $N$ 这么多。这个社会是什么样子？是不是总体而言，在家庭外面的社会，男性比女性更有价值、更强大、更占据权威地位、更有决策权和话语权？\n女性群体的共同困境 当这种情况发生的时候，对所有女性而言，是什么处境？这答案很简单，例子无数。疫情期间为女医护募捐安心裤，就是其一，医院里做决策的高位者是男性，他们怎么会对低位女性的不便感同身受？更不用说当警察、法官，可以发出声音的人都是男性居多的时候，这个社会的法律和舆论会如何倾斜？这根本不需要模型，就是我们的现实社会。这是单女和婚女在博弈吗？不是。因为这样的社会对婚女同样有害，比如家暴判刑打折、婚内强奸免罪。\n这是消灭家庭主妇就能彻底解决的问题吗？不是。不当家庭主妇只是让等式里面的 $X$ 不为 0 而已，并没有消除这个差距。\n女性价值的系统性压制 更何况上面还没有说这个等式的“做到”是怎么实现的，是所有男性从小都比女性更努力、更勤奋，以便保证自己比对方更加强大吗？这是一个思路（也是男性声称自己在做的），但是努力很难，增大 $Y$ 很难，大多数人只想当咸鱼。所以另一个思路就是减小 $X$，这就是老祖宗的思路，让女性裹脚不能出门、被教育和职场排除，$X$ 趋近于 0，这样这个等式就可以轻松实现了。现在虽然不裹脚了，大家能上学能工作了，社会对高社会价值的女性的贬抑依然没有停止。因为大家心里都明白，$X$ 越大，找到合适的 $Y$ 的可能性越小，亏损的概率越高。所以就连有的女性自己也会内化这种秩序，让自己的 $X$ 刚刚好能达到自己能看上的那类男人可以负担得起的值，又不至于太高。简言之，在以婚姻作为幸福殿堂的社会，“女生读那么多书有什么用，还不是要嫁人”是一条真理。\n平等婚姻的虚幻性 那么问题到底在哪里？\n“那年杏花微雨，你说你是果郡王，也许从一开始便都是错的。” 当你想要创造一个这样的等式的时候，你必然会推导出这样的结论。这是客观的、符合逻辑，不以个人的喜好和善恶为转移的。\n也就是说，所谓的“平等的婚姻”是不存在的。一旦存在婚内生育，那么全体女性必然面临薛定谔的失权。不是婚姻内失权，就是婚姻外失权。无论如何，都得选一个。\n“个体婚制是一个伟大的历史的进步，但同时它同奴隶制和私有制一起，却开辟了一个一直继续到今天的时代，在这个时代中，任何进步同时也是相对的退步，因为在这种进步中一些人的幸福和发展是通过另一些人的痛苦和受压抑而实现的。”\n最后说一下，某些男权男和男权女看到这个等式，一定会发出惊天控诉，“女权物化女性！”解释一下，我理解的不物化，是指 $N$ 为无穷大，也就是说这个等式无论如何不可能成立，所以一开始就放弃求等，放弃合作。\n而你理解的不物化，就是 $N=0$。 那个味儿大概是，如果我没物化自己，而你又缺个肾，我就应该把肾摘了白送你。这样的人麻烦不要说话。\n原文内容：一女昏，五女困 “一女昏，五女困”。昏因这个机构，每吸入一个女人去昏，就造成五个女人受困。\n昏女本身的困境 她的产道和子宫不再是她自己的，她的家庭劳动免费输出，她的社会劳动输出值被压制，甚至不再参加社会劳动。顺便她也丢掉了原生家庭的资源和财富：宅基地没她的、房子没她的（她附身丈夫的宅基地和房子，她再无拿回原生家庭资源的正当性）\n她的大姑子或者小姑子的困境 昏女促成丈夫正当地吃掉他家的资源和财富，宅基地、房子、继承权等。而大姑子小姑子自然被剥夺了应有的份额。“她们总不能让自己的兄弟一家喝西北风吧，她们总还总还可以找婆家有房住、有饭吃，她们不亏”\n她的女儿的困境 昏姻这套逻辑的强大就在于它的全面覆盖性，昏女的女儿被一个没有生出她的人冠姓，从小背负了“小棉袄”的责任，被当成“别人家的昏女“暂养在此家。她的母亲，连冠姓权都保不住的母亲，无法成为真正的保护她爱护她的母亲，因为她自身难保。\n婚姻制度本身+不合理的相关法律法规和社会相关身份压迫。 整个社会上层建筑都在服务于家庭，不对应该是逼迫着人们必须以“家庭”的形式考虑问题。 这里插入一点自己的思考，例如美国是以个人形式交税，养老也是与个人挂钩，而北欧等虽然“文明”的高福利国家却以家庭收入作为基准交税，个人需要承担社会抚养的支出，再次印证了这句话。 其实很简单，大部分女性不参与婚姻这种没有任何好处的合作，就可以。 女性避开婚育，去投入社会竞争，争取社会地位、高收入，领导权和话语权。生活会更好。 逻辑非常强。婚姻制度，无论婚姻中女性过的好与不好。本质上都是男权社会的分支。 如果是女利主义者，会奉劝大家擦亮眼睛。但是女权主义者，知道这玩意儿就是男权社会最重要的基石。是必须要被消灭的产物。 在我看来昏和赌没区别，再怎么研究规则都不如远离赌桌。 原文内容：寻找公平——婚姻剩余价值说 本文宗旨在于劝告组员们以及你们的亲朋好友，如果结婚，婚后一定要平分家务，一切以各种理由（比如女人心细所以适合干家务，男人做不来等）劝女人包揽大部分家务的行为都是赤裸裸的剥削，望周知。理由如下：\n首先，法律不承认婚姻中的劳动价值。让我们来解析一下《婚姻法》40条的规定：夫妻书面约定婚姻关系存续期间所得的财产归各自所有，一方因抚育子女、照料老人、协助另一方工作等付出较多义务的，离婚时有权向另一方请求补偿，另一方应当予以补偿。这条看起来很公平，其实：\n①前提是夫妻财产书面约定婚后财产归各自所有，没有书面约定的，婚后分居等情形造成事实上的各自所得财产由各自和保管使用也行。\n②实践中的赔偿数额很少。在（2014）源民初字第1507号离婚纠纷民事判决书中，男女双方结婚20余年，女方在分居期间承担了照顾孩子和老人的义务，要求男方补偿52万元，最后法院只支持了8万元（法院在补偿数额方面会参考劳动时间、强度、繁杂程度、因照顾家庭而放弃的个人发展机会、经济支出和当地居民的基本生活水平）。\n③有已婚妇女发言说，我虽然天天给老公孩子做饭，但是老公银行卡都交给我保管，他的一切身家都在我手里，我不需要什么补偿。其实这里面除了离婚时共有财产分配的问题之外，还涉及到另一个一直被忽视的问题，就家务劳动到底有多大价值。 解析如下：法律不承认家务劳动的价值，就意味着家务劳动没有价值了吗？其实相反，婚姻中的家务劳动因为太有价值，反而无从估量。这里引用《好的婚姻，要守护财产和爱》中的观点：事业有成的律师，离婚时净身出户，没几年就恢复元气，业绩仍然蒸蒸日上，其他行业同理。原因是离婚时女方虽然可以分走男方的钱，但是绝对分不走男方自身的无形资产——可实现财富、地位、名声等元素的自身价值。男方之所以能取得这样的无形资产，正是因为配偶承担了大量的家务劳动，这种无私的付出，让男方没有了后顾之忧，男方得以从家庭中解放出来，将更多的时间和精力投入到事业中。而离婚时，男方的无形资产原本有她的功劳，却被对方无偿独占了。\n原书写得很好下面直接摘抄：\n「至此，婚姻中剩余价值的概念也就呼之欲出了。\n产业中，资本家主要通过强迫工人延长劳动时间的方法来赚取利润。\n婚姻中，一方主要通过强迫另一方延长家务劳动时间的方法来赚取无形资产。\n产业中的剩余价值本来是工人劳动的产物，应归工人所有，却被资本家凭借对企业的所有权无偿独占，这就是资本家剥削工人发财致富的秘密。\n婚姻中的剩余价值本来含有一部分夫妻的共同付出，但在离婚后却被不从事家务的一方无偿独占了，这就是一方剥削另一方而获取无形资产的秘密。\n这才是法律并未完全承认家务劳动价值的证据。」\n这也是为何女性离婚时往往要求对方净身出户的原因之一：\n一方面，不从事家务劳动的一方无偿独占了这部分剩余价值，有能力持续创造财富； 另一方面，从事家务劳动的一方，尤其是家庭主妇，离婚后没有创造财富的能力，就指望着眼前的财产过日子，自然要求对方净身出户了。\n《婚姻法司法解释（三）》的价值内核希望女性走向经济独立，实现从家庭到职场的蜕变。法律并没有强迫夫妻一方必须承担更多的家务劳动。女性多是从事家务劳动的一方是上千年来封建社会“男主外，女主内”的文化惯性导致。这不仅与现代男女平等的价值观相悖，而且与我国法律所倡导的价值观冲突。\n在这种传统文化惯性下，一部分女性甘愿全职从事家务，并坐享丈夫所创造的财富；另一部分女性虽仍在职场，但丈夫及其长辈仍沉醉于这种封建文化思想中，仍在家做甩手掌柜。丧偶式育儿已经把职场女性压得喘不过气来，因家务分担不均而引发的离婚案也不少。这又往往被归结为“因生活琐事”而离婚。\n「离婚时没有赡养费，导致了这种生育和家务付出得不到充分的补偿，剩余价值归一方所有也就成了必然结果。同样是夫妻财产共有制的法国，则制定了“离婚赡养费”的规定。虽然其理论基础不是剩余价值，目的是平衡因离婚导致的夫妻双方生活条件的差异，却起到了一定的平衡剩余价值的作用。」\n如果我国婚姻法能够建立一套完善的离婚赡养费制度，也许能缓和因生育和家务付出不公而带来的诸多矛盾。无论夫妻间采用何种家庭分工，在离婚时长期进行家务劳动的一方都能得到法律保障。\n笔者提出剩余价值的概念，并非要挑唆男女关系，而是希望男女双方都能深刻地认识到：让一方承担全部或主要家务，实际上是在让美好的婚姻变成一场隐形剥削。\n阿慧就是一个典型的例子。结婚前，她和丈夫都从事课外培训行业，但各自的资源不在同一城市。由于感情需求，阿慧接受了异地恋并最终结婚了。她一直都坚持等事业走上正轨后再生孩子，但丈夫却因为家里的压力急着生。在此期间，阿慧发现自己意外怀孕了。她想打胎，但医生说打胎可能会导致她失去生育能力，这让她很纠结。如果把孩子生下来，就要到丈夫的城市生活育儿，事业很难从头再来。实际上，很多夫妻关系中出现的问题，远比这个例子复杂、揪心。\n传统的中国家庭文化，要求女性回归家庭，男性在外拼搏事业，形成依赖型婚姻。现代婚姻制度要求男女平等，都要靠自己的努力创造财富，杜绝依附型婚姻、敛财型婚姻。这必然把女性从家庭拉到社会竞争之中。如今，很多都市女性早已意识到了这一点，而部分男性却还未转变意识。他们要求职场女性不仅要赚钱，还要顾家。最终，职场女性就在现代婚姻制度和传统家庭文化的夹缝中生存，迟迟不敢步入婚姻，又或者被压垮后选择逃出婚姻这座围城。\n见过了那么多离婚案，我认为平等健康的夫妻关系应该是：对外，鼓励双方都充分参与社会竞争，实现自身的社会价值。这种社会价值，不仅会带来社会地位、权力、金钱等附属品，还会带来自我认可和外部认可，满足内在的精神追求。对内，应鼓励双方分担家务，共同育儿。双方才会更加体谅对方，才会容易产生共情，关系才能持久。\n目前，我们社会中的一部分夫妻却不是这样。丈夫在外面累死累活，把赚到的微薄收入还了房贷后，是没法请保姆的。不工作的妻子，会对丈夫有诸多不满，甚至拿别人的丈夫来比较。诸如，你整天在外面忙，也不做家务，也没见你赚钱。看看邻居家的谁谁谁，多有本事。这就导致丈夫想逃离家里，假装在加班，实际上是在打游戏、在打麻将、在胡吃海塞。丈夫呢？没参与家务，也没法理解妻子育儿之不易，回到家做甩手掌柜，甚至“诈尸式育儿”，抱怨妻子做得不够好，觉得妻子靠他养着，还不好好伺候他全家。一百件类似的生活琐事，终会把妻子压垮。这种家庭分工是互害型的。\n「剩余价值产生的内因是夫妻一方承担了过多的家务劳动。消除剩余价值最好的办法是夫妻双方分担家务、共同育儿。在客观条件允许的情况下，可以请钟点工分担家务，释放出夫妻的时间，以便投入自己的事业中。」\n当家政行业发达了，家务劳动市场价格也就趋于稳定，家庭分工就会转化为社会分工，这能帮助更多的人正确认识自己的价值。究竟给他人当保姆，还是在自己家当“保姆”，还是从事其他社会分工，自有理性判断。\n我再补充我自己的看法：摈弃男主外女主内这种观点，现在大部分家庭都是男女各有自己的事业小孩爸妈带，其实本质没有变，只是从剥削妻子的剩余价值变成剥削爸妈的剩余价值。要想解决这个问题，除了找家政别无他法，毕竟有前期投入才有后期回报。当然还有一种釜底抽薪法：不要孩子，没有孩子的人生会有不一样的精彩。\n总结：结婚≠更好的生活，相反，结婚＝更重的负担，而这种负担，不应该只由一方（现实中大部分是女方）来承受。如果另一半能够担起他那份重量，那么你的婚姻就是健康的，如果不能，那么你的婚姻就是一场没有公平可言的残酷剥削。\n不能同意更多！我曾经告诉自己要像男人一样活，后来发现这句话不妥，“像男人一样活”的本质就是像一个“人”一样活着，只是在男权社会里，女性成了“第二性”。成为了依附者，活得不像个“人”。 我之所以说“首先是人”，是希望你能想想，人最想要的是什么，而不是女人最想要的是什么。 原文内容：通过“囚徒困境”，理解婚姻对女性的剥削 看了博弈论，发现很多事情都敞亮了。太长可以只看黑体字，大致那么个意思。 婚姻也是一种博弈，而男权社会往往通过种种谎言，世代相传，让女性忽略了自己在婚姻中失去了什么，把女性困在婚姻中，进行剥削和压迫。\n两性中的囚徒困境 在博弈论中，有个很著名的理论——“囚徒困境”。\n两个被捕的人，如果同时交代罪行，那么每人判两年型；如果一方交代，而另一方隐瞒罪行，交代的一方无罪释放，另一方判刑3年；如果两方都拒不承认，那么各判一年。如果这样的情况是一次性的，自己交代，而对方不交代，这样的结果对自己最为有利，而对方也这样想，往往最后，都会同时出卖对方。而如果双方是长期合作关系，或者考虑到出狱后对方打击报复自己的可能性，那么采取均不承认的策略，就更为有利。\n放在婚姻关系中看，结婚的双方也可以看做是长期合作关系，面临着经营家庭财产、养育小孩，照顾老人等各种事务。如果有一方不那么尽心尽力，比如出轨，或者仍把重心放在维系自己的原生家庭，把本该用来建设和维护家庭的精力，金钱，投入到其他地方，而对于另一方来说，就意味着背叛。如同两个合作伙伴一样，一个全力以赴，另一个偷奸耍滑，这就是背叛。\n男女双方在婚姻中的角色 女性在婚姻中，提供了极大的价值，付出了极大的隐形成本，容易受到伤害而保障几乎没有，非常可惜的是，而在当前的社会大众中，这并不是共识。 女性在婚姻中，通常需要承担代孕 + 保姆 + 心理咨询师 + 本职工作，男性节省了很多精力，专注在工作中，而很可惜，成果并不会实现共享。\n由于社会传统的角色分工，结婚后，女性面临着家务，生育小孩，照顾老人等等事务，而这些事务重复，琐碎，隐形，不容易被看见，也不容易获得进步。换句话说就是很无聊，而无聊对于人会造成除了工作本身之外的消耗，也是一项成本。在职场上，这种琐碎的工作，很少有人愿意承担，人人都看得见这种劣势，如果一个人无缘无故地被要求一直承担这项工作，他会认为这是不公平的。之前看过一个新闻，国外有员工投诉公司，理由是工作很无聊，结果竟然胜诉了，并获得不菲的赔偿。法律也认可，无聊对人的消耗。而在家庭生活中，女性像是无怨无悔和这些狗屁倒灶的事情绑定在一起，被认定为就是你该干的，不容辩驳。\n同时，女性还面临着维系双方关系，提供情绪价值等一些更为隐形的事务。在传统的女性性格中，总是提议女性要温柔，善解人意，而很少有认可，这也是一种付出。常见的有，“男人长不大，只会变老”，“女人这样做男人离不开你”等等，都是在琢磨着女性的情绪价值。女性往往需要倾听家庭成员的心声，安抚他们的情绪，在男人失意彷徨的时候，支持他，在小孩面临成长的困惑和烦恼时，跟他一起面对，在老人孤独的时候，陪伴他们，在家庭成员之间产生冲突的时候，调节缓和他们的关系。如果不承认这项工作的意义，心理咨询师怎么是一项工作呢？不同的是，心理咨询师有经济回报，而女性在进行这些工作的时候，完全隐身。\n而新时代，还对女性提出了第三种要求，就是经济价值，在完成上述这些工作的同时，还要赚钱，至少也是能养活自己，最好在职场上有点成绩。而一个人的精力往往是有限的，当她在家庭中付出如此巨大的精力，对工作的投入就会减少。这样就会被污名化成，女性不适合工作，更适合在家里。而工作，为女性提供了离开家庭牢笼的可能性，只有这项工作，成果才真正属于自己。\n而男性在婚姻生活中，却可以通过种种手段规避责任，只需要赚钱，就可以宣称自己尽到了家庭责任。这叫什么，捡肥差。挑了容易出成绩，而且容易有成长有突破的那部分来做，还抱怨自己赚钱多难多辛苦，岂不是得了便宜又卖乖？\n男性总是更容易逃避育儿责任，通过工作、社交、娱乐活动等等。在女性哺乳期，很多男性压根不管不问，甚至嫌小孩吵闹直接搬去另一个房间睡觉。而女性要面临身体的不适，照顾婴儿，同时还要顾及和婆婆的相处问题，这也是很多妈妈产后抑郁的原因。而在小孩的生活上，男性的关注也少了很多，通过爸爸带孩子就是不行来推卸责任。很多爸爸，平时对小孩的学习不负责任，一有问题就推到妻子身上，甚至在妻子教育小孩写作业的时候，跟孩子站在一边，抄近道希望小孩和自己关系更好。尽管对孩子倾注的精力比起女性少了很多，却可以无差别享受孩子的养老，以孝顺为名。\n通过“我爸妈不容易”逃避调节关系的责任，两边和稀泥，任由妻子一个人面对这样的局面，自己是个那个清白无辜的白莲花，少做少错，都是她们的错与我无关，我还要做夹心饼干，承受来自两边的压力。真是个鸡贼的做法。通过工作忙逃避对对方的责任，很多男人抱怨妻子爱抱怨，往往没有意识到自己对对方的忽视、冷漠，而妻子的抱怨，往往是企图维护和经营这段关系。而男性把这些事情都抛到一边之后，就可以投入到自己的工作上，享受自己的生活，用来提高自己。最后再以对方不能和自己共同进步，不能体谅自己的苦衷为由，取一个更年轻更好骗更好控制的女性，就像更换一个工具一样，轻而易举把女性在婚姻中的付出抹杀，自己保留成果。或者寻求婚姻外的利益，享受更多异性。\n男权社会的谎言 按照博弈论的理论，如果长期合作，一方背叛的话，另一方势必会选择不合作，来保护自己的利益。在婚姻中，我们可以看到，女性往往是遭到背叛的一方，那女性有什么必要和男性合作么？但遗憾的是，我们看到的却是，相当多的女性并没觉得这样有什么不妥。这大概是由于男权社会长期的洗脑吧，让女性心甘情愿做这些事情，让出自己的权力。\n男权社会为了掩盖这个女性被剥削的事实，发明了名目繁多的谎言，将女性培养成合格的工具人。\n最常见的莫过于“爱情”，通过各种影视作品，来告诉女性，你该谈恋爱了，再将谈恋爱和结婚绑定在一起。反复宣传甜甜的恋爱，却没有人告诉她们，恋爱结婚背后的代价。\n通过植入女孩子应该被保护，女孩子只需要负责傻白甜就可以，繁重的复杂的工作由男人来承担种种，剥夺女性向外探索的能力，把女性塑造成更容易被控制的性格。\n以上的种种，都可以得出至少在当前，女性在婚姻中完全是属于被剥削的一方，得不偿失，清醒一点！林毛毛说，没有伤害男人的决心，就不要走到婚姻中去。用囚徒困境来解释，如果对方背叛你，你只有也背叛他，才能保证自己的利益。企图通过付出。 继续洗脑，只是痴人说梦，会让对方继续背叛，有好处的事情，谁不干！当然，最好的就是不要趟这趟浑水。\n阿德勒说过，只有把共同利益看得大于个人利益，才有可能收获幸福的婚姻。在一方剥削另一方的社会，婚姻不可能幸福，不如一开始就拒绝。 婚姻的囚徒 （一）公式 他们说，爱是$X+N=Y$—— $X$是她压缩的梦想， $N$是子宫的债务， 而$Y$是他的社会估值， 在房产证上复利增长。\n他们用爱情公式演算： $X$（她的青春） + $N$（子宫折旧）= $Y$（他的社会估值增量）\n当月光在产房变成债务 当冠姓权成为高利贷 我们终于读懂 薛定谔的猫为何 既死又活\n（二）剩余价值 她抵押睡眠，兑换他的无形资产， 育儿、家务、情绪劳动—— 统统计入“自愿负债”。 离婚时，法官说： “补偿八万，二十年分期。”\n（三）薛定谔的失权 婚内？她是冠姓的输家； 婚外？她是高嫁的猎物。 社会说：“擦亮眼。” 可赌桌的庄家， 早把规则刻进她的盆骨。\n（四）囚徒困境 合作，他独占职场红利； 背叛，她背负“歇斯底里”。 男权社会笑了： “看，她们还在争论—— ‘好男人’算不算彩票经济学？”\n选择合作的那天就签下认罪书：\n\u0026ldquo;自愿放弃睡眠/脊椎/职场上升通道\u0026rdquo; 而典狱长在结婚证背面刻满 免责条款\n我们互相举证 用妊娠纹的账本 计算谁背叛得更彻底 直到判决书从婴儿啼哭里 缓缓升起\n（五）终局\n现在她懂了： 最优解是撕掉婚书， 把N写成∞。 让所有卵精结合的合同， 在子宫的罢工里失效。\n他们说这是棉袄 ——但需要先拆掉你的肋骨作棉芯 他们说这是港湾 ——但只停泊名为丈夫的船 当所有比喻都带着锁链的余温 我们终于学会 用数学反抗神话：\n设 $N=∞$ 解集是 所有不成为母亲的 可能性\n我的思考 婚姻制度的囚徒困境：一场系统性剥削的精密设计 当我们将婚姻制度置于现代社会的解剖台上，一个残酷的真相逐渐浮现：这不是简单的性别矛盾，而是一套精心设计的剥削系统。那些看似温和的“个人选择论”，实则是体制最完美的遮羞布——它让受害者相信自己的是首饰，让压迫以自由意志的名义继续运转。\n生育价值的数学暴政在 $X+N=Y$ 的等式里，暴露了婚姻制度的根本骗局。这个公式要求男性必须始终保持 $N$ 值的优势地位，而社会实现这一目标的方式只有两种：要么系统性压制女性发展（减小 $X$），要么维持男性特权（增大 $Y$）。历史证明，父权制总是双管齐下——从“女子无才便是德”的古代规训，到今日职场中隐形的“母职惩罚”，女性始终被禁在这个数学陷阱里。更可怕的是，当个别女性通过“高嫁”获得表面平衡时，实则是以全体女性的地位下沉为代价，这正是“一女昏，五女困”的深层逻辑。\n家务劳动的资本主义隐喻将婚姻比作工厂并非夸张。家庭主妇的处境与十九世纪纺织女工惊人相似——她们的劳动创造价值却被剥夺所有权，她们的付出支撑体系却得不到体系承认。法律判决中 8 万与 52 万的差距，恰如资本家支付的的微薄工资与工人创造的实际价值间的鸿沟。而当女性同时承担有偿劳动时，就陷入更残酷的“双重工作日”困境，这比马克思批判的资本家剥削更为隐蔽。\n情感操控的规训机制男权社会最精妙的控制，在于将剥削转化为“爱的奉献”。心理咨询师收费的情绪劳动，在婚姻中成为妻子的“天性”；市场价值极高的育儿嫂工作，在家庭里变成“母职本能”。这种情感资本主义不仅榨取女性的劳动，更窃取她们的自我认知，使受害者成为体系的维护者。疫情期间女医护的安心裤事件，正是这种体制性漠视的必然结果——决策者根本看不见那些被定义为“自然责任”的女性需求。\n博弈论揭示的婚姻囚徒困境，实则是场被操纵的游戏。男性默认获得“背叛优势”：社会容忍他们逃避育儿，法律轻判他们的家庭暴力，文化鼓励他们的情感出轨。而女性选择“背叛”（不婚不育）时，却要承受“剩女”污名与生育焦虑的惩罚。这种不对称的博弈规则，注定让女性成为输家。\n解构这场困局的关键，在于认清婚姻制度与资本主义的共谋关系。正如工厂需要廉价劳动力，父权制需要无偿的女性再生产劳动；正如资本需要消费主义，婚姻制度需要浪漫爱意识形态。当北欧福利国家用家庭税制捆绑个体，当美国以个人税制维持职场性别歧视，不同版本的故事背后是相同的逻辑：将女性禁在再生产领域，确保资本主义与父权制的双重运转。\n觉醒的女性正在书写新剧本：当 $N$ 趋向无穷大，当 $X$ 拒绝被定义，这个精心设计的等式终将崩塌。这不是对男性的战争，而是对制度的叛逃——我们不仅要离开赌桌，更要摧毁那个让赌博成为唯一选项的赌场。真正的女性主义革命，或许始于一个简单决定：拒绝用子宫为这个腐朽制度续命。\nWhat Exactly Are We Opposing in the Rejection of Marriage? I. The Core Contradiction Not domestic violence, not unequal chores— but the fundamental math of heterosexual reproduction: Her body pays the principal (pregnancy), while his sperm earns equity (fatherhood).\nII. The Compensation Fallacy \u0026ldquo;Find a good man,\u0026rdquo; they say— as if love could amortize the compound interest of:\nSurname transfer (patrilineal interest)\nCareer penalty (motherhood tax)\nEmotional labor (unpaid subsidiary)\nIII. The Collective Consequence When every marriage follows X + N = Y: [Woman\u0026rsquo;s value] + [Womb\u0026rsquo;s output] = [Man\u0026rsquo;s worth]\nSociety becomes a pyramid scheme— where female advancement is structurally capped at husband-search-appropriate levels.\nIV. The False Binary Married? Your labor is expropriated. Single? Your autonomy is pathologized. The system thrives on this Schrödinger\u0026rsquo;s oppression— where all women lose by merely participating in the probability game.\nV. The Only Exit To set N = ∞: Make motherhood non-negotiable, non-compensable, non-cooperative. Let their precious institution collapse under its own unsustainable arithmetic.\nFootnote: X = female social capital | Y = male social capital N = reproductive value | ∞ = radical decommodification\n","date":"2025-05-16T22:00:44+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%8F%8D%E6%98%8F%E5%88%B0%E5%BA%95%E6%98%AF%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%8D%E5%AF%B9%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88/title_hu_987e0cc150ab3632.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%8F%8D%E6%98%8F%E5%88%B0%E5%BA%95%E6%98%AF%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%8D%E5%AF%B9%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88/","title":"反昏到底是在反对什么？"},{"content":" 鸣谢：\n【转载】如何在“历史垃圾时间”里活下去 原文内容 以史为鉴：做好最坏预期 去对应下90年代初日本和1930年美国的大萧条时期的经济形势和人们的生存状态，提前预判，对极有可能随之而来的类似时期有个心理预期，必要时把生活预期调整为以吃饱饭和能支付的起一间房的房租为目标，不给自己施加任何压力。\n清醒认识：你活在集体精神病院 认识到自己生活在一个巨大的精神病院里。 这个精神病院里主要由自恋型人格障碍的病人（其中一部分还是制定游戏规则的掌权者）+精神被阉割的太监们+正在努力想要成为太监的准太监们以及大批幻想期待渴望从太监那里得到满足的奴婢们组成。 他们互相索取，互相欺骗，互相愚弄，互相撕咬，以彼此拉扯、消耗为生活方式度过一生，如果你不想被裹挟，就要懂得做个安静的，坚定的旁观者，尽可能远离集体，远离人群。\n物理迁徙：用脚投票改变命运 迁徙，家贫走四方，良禽择木而栖，哪里水草充足哪里土壤适合生存就去哪里，对于社会底层的孩子来说，迁徙是最能直接改变命运的路径，地球就是个村。\n精神迁徙：主动脱离系统绑定 肉身无法迁徙的，就从精神上迁徙，精神上脱钩，不和主流社会产生任何强绑定，做到不入局，玩一个失控的游戏就会被失控的游戏规则所牵制束缚带入失控，智者不入哀河。 这里的一切规则，都与我无关。\n降欲修心：切断痛苦代偿循环 降低物欲，要知道高物欲（包括性欲食欲）大多是痛苦内在匮乏的代偿，去解决内在问题，观心修心，接纳容许，看到自己，而不是通过不断喝海水解渴……减少一切不必要的消费，不借！贷！不买房，不做任何投资，除了投资自己。（如增加体能，学习知识、技能，旅行看世界，培养某项爱好等）\n拒绝接盘：破除孝道绑架 上不养老下不养小。 养老从来不是个体的责任，发达国家集举国之力通过几代人的努力打造的社会养老制度托起的重担，放在人类社会任何一个个体身上都等同于要求一个人举起一辆车，哪怕勉强举起来的，最终都会被压垮。逃避不可耻，不需要有任何羞耻感和愧疚感，你的父母也许很可怜，但她们自身活的如此艰难还把你带到这个世上，要你来负担她们的老年生活，不像以前人们普遍寿命短，现代人的寿命到80，90岁已是常态，也就是一个50，60岁的人要负担另外一个人长达20年的老年生活……这类人也不是真正意义上的”父母“，真正意义上的父母是托举是成全孩子，是养育过程中的不求回报，做不到无偿无条件对孩子付出可以选择不生。也只有一代人能够坚持做到上不养老，不去接盘本应该社会承担的责任，那么通过子宫“蓄奴”生孩子当免费护工用的“父母”才会越来越少，生孩子纯粹因为爱和通过养育孩子的过程享受给予的快乐体验，不求回报去成全托举孩子的父母才会越来越多。\n精准结盟：建立生存共同体 学会相信一小部分人，去努力找到价值观一致，生活理念相同志同道合的人，和她们结盟组建生活搭子互相扶持在困难时期活下去，记住，人是因为爱而链接的，不是靠血缘，更加不是靠性，跳出思维框架打开格局，如果找不到也没关系，我们还有自己，还可以跟不同的事产生链接。\n手艺至上：逃离白领绞肉机 去做蓝领的工作。 蓝领工作是随着年龄渐长手艺的娴熟会越来越变得不可替代，不会出现35岁以后就失业的情况，传统教育培养出来的螺丝钉哪里都能钉，他们坐在办公室里的那些工作大多都是可以被更年轻的，更便宜的人工替代，要意识到把人分为三六九等，把职业分为高低贵贱都是为了为了激发你害怕成为弱者，害怕落后的恐惧心理，恐惧是成本最低用来操控人心的工具，把自己从恐惧中解放出来，你不玩“人上人”的游戏，你就不会被成为“人下人”的恐惧支配，靠怕输驱动的“赢”是危房加盖，终究有一天会倒塌，应试教育下的“天子骄子”人到中年的不断陨落已经可以说明一些情况了，毕竟鸡蛋从外打破是食物，从内打破才是生命。\n蛰伏修炼：在阅读中等待转机 大量阅读，阅读是随身携带的避难所，在避难所里蛰伏下去投资身体和大脑，静静等待吧。\n最后年轻人一定不要想着去死，该死的不是我们，我们要好好强身健体等着该死的一个个死去的那一天。\n该死的不是我们 是他们把房价炒成天价，然后嘲笑年轻人不努力；\n是他们把 996 包装成福报，把猝死美化为“奋斗者之光”；\n是他们一边喊着“人口红利”，一边把活生生的人当作消耗品；\n是他们制造焦虑，贩卖解药，再把解药变成新的毒药。\n我们做错了什么？\n我们按时纳税，遵守规则，勤勤恳恳工作。\n我们相信知识改变命运，却发现自己不过是更昂贵的韭菜；\n我们以为勤劳致富，结果只是让老板换了辆更贵的车。\n他们却在私人飞机上高谈阔论“年轻人要吃苦”，\n在游艇上教育我们“要学会延迟满足”，\n用我们的血汗钱买下整个学区房，\n然后说“寒门再难出贵子”。\n该死的不是我们这些想好好生活的人，\n是那些制定规则又随时修改规则的人。\n是那些把社会变成赌场却自己做庄的人，\n是那些吸干年轻人的血还说“这是为你们好”的人。\n但别急着绝望。\n历史告诉我们：\n所有靠压榨维持的系统，\n最终都会死在自己的贪婪里。\n我要做的，\n就是活得比他们长，\n看得比他们远，\n等到大厦崩塌的那天，\n站在废墟上笑着说：\n“看，我说过该死的不是我们。”\n记住：\n狼吃羊的时候，\n从来不会承认自己残暴，\n只会怪羊跑得不够快。\n但草原上的狼，\n最后都变成了标本。\n而羊群，\n永远生生不息。\n在“历史垃圾时间”中保持清醒与韧性 这些生存策略的核心，其实是在一个系统性衰退的时代里，如何避免被吞噬、被异化、被消耗。它们不是消极的躺平，而是一种清醒的自我保护，甚至是一种无声的反抗。\n认清现实，但不被现实驯化 “历史垃圾时间”的本质，是旧秩序在崩塌，而新秩序尚未成型。在这个过渡期，大多数人会被焦虑、恐惧和虚假希望裹挟，成为系统继续运转的燃料。而真正的生存智慧，在于看清游戏的本质后，选择不参与，或者以最小代价参与。\n拒绝被定义，保持流动性 无论是物理迁徙还是精神迁徙，本质都是拒绝被固定在一个注定下沉的船上。现代社会最大的幻觉，就是让人相信“稳定”是常态，而动荡是意外。但历史告诉我们，动荡才是常态，稳定只是短暂的喘息。保持流动性，就是保持选择权。\n低欲望不是放弃，而是战略收缩 高消费社会依赖人的欲望维持运转，而当个人主动降低欲望时，其实是在切断被剥削的链条。这不是贫穷，而是一种资源再分配——把原本被资本收割的金钱和时间，重新投资在自己身上。\n对抗集体癫狂，需要极强的定力 社会是一个巨大的剧场，每个人都在扮演角色，而一旦有人拒绝剧本，就会被视为异类。真正的自由，不是反抗所有人，而是不被任何人的期待绑架，包括亲人和社会的道德勒索。\n最终，活下来就是胜利 在漫长的历史周期里，个体的力量微不足道，但个体的清醒可以成为一种传染性的力量。不要幻想改变世界，但要确保自己不在混乱中崩溃。\n活下来，保持健康，保持思考能力，等待新的可能性出现。\n这不是悲观，而是一种冷酷的乐观——承认黑暗，但拒绝被黑暗吞噬。\n该死的从来不是努力生存的人，而是制造这种生存困境的系统。我们的任务不是去死，而是看着它先死。\n要活着，要清醒地活着，要带着尊严活着。活得足够久，久到能亲眼看见这套吃人逻辑的崩塌。\n要活得比这个腐朽的系统更长久。要在他们的废墟上跳舞，要在历史的灰烬中找到那些和我们一样拒绝被异化的灵魂。\n不要用自我苛责来合理化不公，该死的从来不是努力生存的普通人，而是那些制造苦难却逍遥法外的规则制定者。 把愤怒转化为清晰的认知和行动——该消失的是腐朽的规则，而不是被规则压垮的人。 剥削系统依赖大多数人的自我怀疑和恐惧运转。当你拒绝成为“人上人”游戏的参与者时，就已经在削弱它的控制力。真正的反抗未必是激烈的冲突，而是安静地退出游戏，并让更多人看清游戏的荒诞。 历史周期律残酷但公平：所有压榨普通人的系统，最终都会因贪婪反噬自身。我们要做的，是保持健康、清醒和移动能力，活到看他们先崩溃的那一天。 世界不该如此，但我们能决定自己如何存在。 该死的从来不是认真生活的人，而是那些把世界变成地狱还指责他人不够忍耐的既得利益者。我们活着，他们才该害怕。 具体生存方法论 既然拒绝成为系统的牺牲品，那就必须制定切实可行的生存策略。\n心理防御：建立精神防火墙 目标：避免被社会焦虑、集体癫狂和内耗吞噬。\n具体方法： ✅ 信息断舍离\n减少无意义的信息摄入（如短视频、热搜、焦虑贩卖类内容）。 定期“数字排毒”，比如每周一天不碰社交媒体。 ✅ 认知重构\n每当自我怀疑时，问自己：“这是事实，还是别人灌输给我的恐惧？” 建立自己的价值评判体系，不依赖外界认可。 ✅ 情绪管理\n练习正念冥想，减少情绪内耗。 允许自己愤怒，但避免让愤怒变成自我攻击。 经济策略：降低系统依赖性 目标：减少被资本收割的可能，提高抗风险能力。\n具体方法： ✅ 极简消费\n区分“需要\u0026quot;和“想要”，减少非必要支出。 不盲目追求品牌、身份象征类消费。 ✅ 财务避险\n不负债：避免房贷、车贷、消费贷等长期债务。 现金为王：保持至少 6 个月的生活费储备。 不盲目投资：拒绝股市、币圈等高风险赌博式理财。 职业选择：逃离“白领绞肉机” 目标：避免成为可替代的螺丝钉，寻找更可持续的生存方式。\n具体方法： ✅ 保持随时离开的能力\n定期更新简历。 学习新技能，避免被单一职业绑定。 社交策略：建立真实共同体 目标：摆脱虚假社交，找到真正可互助的盟友。\n具体方法： ✅ 远离消耗型关系\n减少与“精神太监”（只会抱怨但不敢改变的人）的互动。 警惕“正能量暴君”（强迫你乐观的人）。 ✅ 减少无效社交\n不讨好无关紧要的人。 身体与精神健康：活到看他们先死的那天 目标：保持身心健康，避免被系统拖垮。\n具体方法： ✅ 体能储备\n规律运动（跑步、游泳、力量训练）。 学习基础医疗知识（如急救、自然疗法）。 ✅ 精神韧性\n每天留出“自我时间”（阅读、写作、艺术创作）。 培养“无用之用”的爱好（如种菜、徒步）。 ✅ 睡眠与饮食\n保证 7-8 小时睡眠，避免熬夜透支。 减少外卖，学习简单烹饪，降低生活成本。 终极策略：保持迁徙自由 目标：不被单一地点、职业或身份绑架，随时能换赛道。\n具体方法： ✅ 物理迁徙\n研究低成本宜居地（如东南亚、南欧、小城市）。 办理能增加流动性的证件（如护照、签证、技能证书）。 ✅ 精神迁徙\n学习新语言，打开信息茧房。 保持“局外人”心态，不把任何系统当作归宿。 我的生存法则 心理上：清醒认知，拒绝被规训。 经济上：降低负债，现金为王。 职业上：选择抗衰退赛道，保持离开能力。 社交上：远离消耗者，结盟真实伙伴。 健康上：体能储备，精神韧性。 终极自由：保持迁徙能力，不绑定任何系统。

Marketing Strategy Creating Value for Target Customers Learning Objectives\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\n✅ Define the major steps in designing a customer-driven marketing strategy:\n✨ segmentation, targeting, differentiation and positioning\n✅ List and discuss the major bases for segmenting the customer\n✅ Explain how companies identify market segments and choose a market targeting strategy\nLecture Overview Market Segmentation (S) Market Target (T) Differentiation and Positioning (P) Communicating and Delivering the Chosen Position Market Segmentation (S) Major Segmentation Variables Market segmentation is the process that companies use to divide large heterogeneous markets into small markets that can be reached more efficiently and effectively with products and services that match their unique needs.\nThere is no single way to segment a market A market has to try different segmentation variables, alone and in combination, to find the best way to view the market structure Here we look at the major geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral variables Geographic Segmentation Dividing the market into different geographic units such as nations, regions, states, counties, etc Many companies localize their products, advertising, promotion, and sales efforts to fit the needs of individual regions and cities Demographic Segmentation Demographic segmentation divides the market into groups based on variables such as age, gender, family size, family life cycle, income, occupation, education, religion, race, generation, and nationality. It is the most popular segmentation method because consumer needs, wants, and usage often vary closely with demographic variables and are easier to measure than other types of variables.\nAge and life-cycle stage segmentation is the process of offering different products or using different marketing approaches for different age and life-cycle groups Gender segmentation divides the market based on sex (male or female) Income segmentation divides the market into different income groups Psychographic Segmentation most powerful Divides buyers into different groups based on social class, lifestyle, or personality characteristics By studying the activities, interests, and opinions (AIOs) E.g. What kind of hobbies do you have? (activities) What is important to you (interests)? How do you see the world (opinions)? Behavioral Segmentation Behavioral segmentation divides buyers into groups based on their knowledge, attitudes, uses, or responses to a product.\nOccasion Benefits sought User status Usage rate Loyalty status Occasion segmentation divides buyers into groups according to occasions when they get the idea to buy, actually make purchases, or respond to a product.\nBenefit segmentation requires finding the major benefits people look for in the product class, the kinds of people who look for each benefit, and the major brands that deliver each benefit.\nUser status divides buyers into ex-users, potential users, first- time users, and regular users of a product.\nUsage rate divides buyers into light, medium, and heavy product users.\nLoyalty status divides buyers into groups according to their degree of loyalty.\nRequirements for Effective Segmentation To be useful, a market segment must be:\nMeasurable The size, purchasing power, and profiles of the segments can be measured Accessibe The market segments can be effectively reached and served Substantial The market segments are large or profitable enough Differentiable The segments respond differently to different marketing mix elements and programs Actionable Effective programs can be designed for attracting and serving the segments Marketing Target (T) Segmentation reveals the opportunities in different market segments. A firm must evaluate various segments to decide how many and which segments it can serve best. Target market consists of a set of buyers who share common needs or characteristics in a segment (s) that company decides to serve. A firm should consider:\nSegment size and growth Segment structural attractiveness Company objectives and resources Evaluating Market Segments Segment size and growth:\nSmaller versus larger segments Growth potential Segment structural attractiveness:\nLevel of competition Substitute products Power of buyers Power of suppliers Company objectives and resources:\nCompetitive advantage Availability of resources Consistent with company objectives Selecting Target Market Segments undifferentiated marketing Differentiated marketing Concentrated marketing Micromarketing Undifferentiated marketing (mass-marketing) ignores market segment differences and targets the whole market with one offer.\nFocuses on common needs rather than what\u0026rsquo;s different Modern markets have strong doubts about this strategy Differentiated marketing (segmented marketing) targets several different market segments and designs separate offers for each.\nGoal is to achieve higher sales and stronger position More expensive than undifferentiated marketing Concentrated marketing (niche marketing) targets a large share of one or a few segments of niches\nLimited company resources Better knowledge of the market More effective and efficient Micromarketing is the practice of tailoring products and marketing programs to suit the needs and wants of specific individuals and local customer groups.\nIndividual marketing tailors products and marketing programs to the needs of individual customers. Also known as mass customization, one-to-one marketing.\nDifferentiation and Positioning (P) Value proposition Information overloaded → marketers must choose a value proposition. How a company will create differentiated value for targeted segments and what positions it wants to occupy in those segments. Product position is the way the product is defined by consumers on important attributes. Choosing a Differentiation and Positioning Strategy\nIdentifying a set of possible competitive advantages to build a position Choosing the right competitive advantages Selecting an overall positioning strategy Identigying Competitive Advantages to Build a Position Competitive advantage is the advantage over competitors gained by offering greater value either through lower prices or by providing more benefits that justify higher prices.\nTo the extent that a company can differentiate and position itself as providing superior customer value, it gains competitive advantage.\nIdentifying a set of possible competitive advantages to build a position by providing superior value from:\nProduct differentiation Service differentiation Channels (distribution) People Image Choosing the Right Competitive Advantages A company should develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for each brand and stick to it.\nSome marketers think that companies should position themselves on more than one differentiator.\nHow many differences to promote? Why? Which difference to promote? Not all brand differences are meaningful or worthwhile; Not every difference makes a good differentiator Which Differences to Promote —— Important Criteria:\nImportant: The difference delivers a highly valued benefit to target buyers. Distinctive: Competitors do not offer the difference, or the company can offer it in a more distinctive way. Superior: The difference is superior to other ways that customers might obtain the same benefit. Communicable: The difference is communicable and visible to buyers. Preemptive: Competitors cannot easily copy the difference. Affordable: Buyers can afford to pay for the difference. Profitable: The company can introduce the difference profitably. Developing a Positioning Statement Positioning statement is a statement that summarizes company or brand positioning\nFormat: To (target segment and need) our (brand) is (concept) that (point of difference).\nExamples of Positioning Statement \"To busy, mobile people who need to always be in the loop, the iPad is a multi-touch screen wireless connectivity solution that provides the best way to experience the Web, email, photos, and videos with just the touch of a finger.\" Lecture Review Product Strategy The Marketing Process Lecture Overview What is a Product? Product Decisions Branding Strategy: Building Strong Brands What is a Product? A product is anything that can be offered in a market for attention, acquisition, use, or consumption that might satisfy a need or want.\nBroadly defined, \u0026ldquo;products\u0026rdquo; also include services, events, persons, places, organizations, ideas, or mixes of these.\nServices are a form of product that consists of activities, benefits, or satisfactions offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in ownership.\nE.g., Doctor\u0026rsquo;s exam, legal advice, entertainment, haircut, concert A company should consider four special service characteristics when designing marketing programs. How Services Differ form Goods Service Characteristics Characteristics Description Marketing Challenges Marketing Actions Intangibility Services that cannot be touched, seen, tasted, heard or felt in the same manner as goods. Difficulty in product evaluation Offer tangible token of service; Develop a brand Inseparability A characteristic of services that allows them to be produced and consumed simultaneously. Customers must be present; Customers must participate Make locations and times convenient; Make participation fun/beneficial Heterogeneity A characteristic of services that makes them less standardised and uniform than goods. Hard to maintain the service quality Training and standardization Perishability A characteristic of services that prevents them from being stored, warehoused or inventoried. Unused capacity is \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo;; High demand cannot be met Match demand and supply A company\u0026rsquo;s market offering often includes both tangible goods and intangible services.\nAt one extreme, the offer may consist of a pure tangible good, such as soap or toothpaste. At the other extreme are pure services.\nProducts, Services, and Experiences\nTo differentiate their offers, marketers are creating and managing customer experiences with their brands or company.\nProduct and Service Classifications Consumer products are products and services for personal consumption. Classified by how consumers buy them and thus how to market them. Convenience products are consumer products and services that the customer usually buys frequently, immediately, and with a minimum comparison and buying effort.\nE.g. newspapers, candy, fast food Shopping products are less frequently purchased consumer products and services that customers compare carefully on suitability, quality, price, and style in the process of selection and purchase.\nSpecialty products are consumer products and services with unique characteristics or brand identification for which a significant group of buyers is willing to make a special purchase effort.\nE.g. designer brands, luxury goods Unsought products are consumer products that the consumer does not know about or knows about but does not normally think of buying.\nE.g. life insurance, funeral services, blood donations Three Levels of Products Actual Product:\nActual product, features, design, packaging, quality level, brand name developed to deliver the core benefit. Core Custoemr Value:\nWhat is the buyer really buying? What is the core, problem-solving benefits and value consumers seek. Augmented Product:\nAdditional customer services and benefits around the core benefit and actual product to create the most satisfying customer experience. Three Levels of Products - Hotel\nActual Product To deliver the core benefit through Core Customer Value What is the buyer really buying? Augmented Product To create the most satisfying customer experience through Product and Service Decisions Individual product decisions Developing a product or service involves defining the benefits that it will offer. These benefits are communicated and delivered by product attributes such as\nQualtiy Features Style and design Quality is the characteristics of a product or service that can satisfy stated or implied customer needs\nProduct features are a competitive tool for differentiating a product from competitors\u0026rsquo; products. It should be assessed based on the value to the customer versus the cost to the company\nProduct style and design add value to customer value.\nBrand is the name, term, sign, or design, or a combination of these, that identifies the maker or seller of a product or service\nPackaging involves designing and producing the container or wrapper for a product. It helps to attract consumer attention, enhance usage experience and drive sale.\nConsumers face with numerous product choices. Attractive packaging helps to stand out from competition A good packaging can give a company an advantage over competitors and boost sales. When Heinz inverted the good old ketchup bottle, sales grew at three times more than competitor Packaging involves two functions\nPrimary Function hold and protect the product Good packaging create instant consumer recognition Lable can be simple tags or complex graphics to\nidentify the product or brand describe attributes provide promotion Product support services augment actual products. Companies must continually:\nAssess the value of current services to obtain ideas for new ones Develop a package of services to satisfy customers and provide profit to the company Product line decisions Product Line is a group of products that are closely related because they may:\nfunction in a similar manner be sold to similar customer groups be marketed through the same types of outlets fall within given price ranges A. Product Line Stretching\nlengthens the product line beyond its current range 3 types: upward, downward or combination of both B. Product Line Filling\nProduct Line Filling occurs when companies add more items within the present range of the line Excess line filling will result in cannibalization and customer confusion Reasons More profits Satisfying dealers Excess capacity Being the leading full-line company Plugging holes to fend off competitors Product mix decisions Product mix (or product portfolio) consists of all the products and items that a particular seller offers for sale. A company\u0026rsquo;s product mix has four dimensions: width, length, depth, and consistency.\nProduct mix width ➔ the number of different product lines Product mix length ➔ the total number of items within a product line Product mix depth ➔ the number of versions offered of each product in the line Product mix consistency refers to how closely related the various product lines are in end use, production requirements, distribution channels, or some other way A company can increase its business in four ways in terms of its product mix:\nIt can add new product lines, widening its product mix. It can lengthen its existing product lines. It can add more versions of each product, deepening its product mix. It can pursue more product line consistency. Branding Strategy: Building Strong Brands Brand represents the consumer\u0026rsquo;s perceptions and feelings about a product and its performance.\nBrand equity is the positive differential effect that knowing the brand name has on customer response to the product or service.\nBrand Development A company has four choices when it comes to developing brands Line Extensions Line extensions occur when a company extends existing brand names to new forms, colors, sizes, ingredients, or flavors of an existing product category.\nAdvantages\nLow-cost, low-risk to introduce new products Meet consumer desires for variety Use excess capacity Occupy more shelf-space form resellers Disadvantages\nConfusion and frustration Cannibalization Brand Extensions Brand extensions extend a brand name to a new or modified product in a new category.\nAdvantages\nInstant recognition and faster acceptance Save the high advertising costs Disadvantages\nConfuse the image of the main brand Harm consumer attitudes toward the other products carrying the same brand name May not be appropriate to a particular new product Multibrands Multibrands are additional brands in the same category\nAdvantages\nEstablish different features and appeal to different buying motives Occupy more shelf-space Disadvantages\nSpending its resources over many brands which each brand only obtains a small market share and none may be very profitable Managing different brand is difficult New Brands New brands are used when existing brands are inappropriate for new products in new product categories or markets.\nLecture Review Pricing Strategy Case study\nWhy do movie theaters sell popcorn?\nThe profit margin for movies is low, with the production firm receiving a commission of around 75%-90%. Popcorn and movies have complementary demand (as seen in the pricing of movie tickets). Pricing is determined by the combination of main and secondary products (similar to KTV). So why don’t movie theaters sell French fries? People will buy the product only if they think the price is reasonable.\nWhat is Price? Price is the amount of money charged for a product or service. More broadly, price is the sum of all the values that consumers give up in order to gain the benefits of having or using a product or service. Price is the only element in the marketing mix that produces revenue; all other elements represent costs. One of the most flexible elements of the marketing mix Common mistakes in Pricing Companies are too quick to reduce prices in order to get a sale rather than convince buyers that their products are worth a higher price Pricing is too cost oriented rather than customer - value oriented Does not take the rest of the marketing mix into account Major Pricing Strategies Consideration in Setting Prices Effective customer-oriented pricing involves understanding how much value consumers place on the benefits they receive from the product and setting a price that captures that value. Major Pricing Strategies Value-Based Pricing Value exchange will not take place unless customer sees positive net value in transaction.\nValue-based pricing uses the buyers\u0026rsquo;perception of value, not the seller\u0026rsquo;s cost, as the key to pricing.\nE.g. luxury cars, branded fashion items and expensive jewelry $$\\text{{Cheap Price}} \\neq \\text{{Best Value}}$$ Good-Value Pricing\nGood - value pricing offers the right combination of quality and good service to fair price. Usually refers to introducing less expensive items to satisfy the basic need. Everyday low pricing (EDLP) involves charging a constant everyday low price with few or no temporary price discounts. High - low pricing involves charging higher prices on an everyday basis but running frequent promotions to lower prices temporarily on selected items. Value-added Pricing\nValue - added pricing attaches value - added features and services to differentiate offers and support higher prices.\nExample 1: Stag umbrella brand by Currim\nRather than dropping prices to match cheaper imports, Currim successfully launched umbrellas with funky designs, cool colors, and value - added features and sold them at even higher prices. Example 2: Airline choice\nWould you fly a cheap or safe airline? Competition-Based Pricing\nConsumers will base their judgments of a product’s value on the prices that competitors charge for similar products. No matter what price you charge relative to the competition—high, low, or in - between—be certain to give customers superior value for that price. Factors to consider:\nComparison of superior customer value offered Strength of competitors Competition pricing strategies Customer price sensitivity Other Internal and External Factors Affecting Price Decisions\nCustomer perceptions of value set the upper limit for prices, and costs set the lower limit. But companies must consider internal and external factors when setting prices. Economic conditions Resellers\u0026rsquo;response to price Government Social concerns New-Product Pricing Strategies Market skimming pricing (price skimming) A strategy with high initial prices to “skim” revenue from segments willing to pay the high price for new product. Market penetration pricing Sets a low new product price to penetrate the market by attracting a large number of buyers to gain market share quickly. Market-Skimming Pricing Market Skimming Set initial high price for high revenue Works when: Superior quality and image Enough buyers Competitors cannot charge lower price When Apple first introduced the iPhone, its initial price was as high as 599 per phone. The phones were purchased only by customers who really wanted the sleek new gadget and could afford to pay a high price for it. Six months later, Apple reduced the price to 399 for an 8 GB model and 499 for the 16 GB model to attract new buyers. Within a year, its prices dropped again to 199 and 299 respectively.\nMarket-Penetration Pricing Market Penetration Set initial low price for high market share Works when: Market is price - sensitive Costs fall with large volume Competition is kept out Low price can be maintained To lure the famously frugal Chinese customers, IKEA slashed its prices when it first opened its stores in China. The penetration pricing strategy worked and gave IKEA 43% market share of China\u0026rsquo;s fast - growing home wares market.\nWhen to use which 4 consideration\nPut price and product together Product Mix Pricing Strategies Product line pricing Product line pricing set price steps between various products in a line based on the cost difference between products in the line, customer evaluation of their features, and competitors’ prices. Perceived quality differences that support the price differences should be established.\nOptional-product pricing Optional product pricing sells optional or accessory products along with the main product. Pricing these options is a sticky problem. The company has to decide which items to include in the base price and which to offer as options. Captive-product pricing Captive product pricing involves products that must be used along with the main product. Producers of the main products often price them low and set high markups on the supplies. In the case of the printer with the highest ink cost of 1,453, the printer itself was priced at a relatively low 850. So, the cost of ink far exceeded that of the machine in just a matter of one year of usage.\nDiscussion\nShould tourist attractions charge high entrance fees (with free paid entertainment facilities) or offer free entry with paid entertainment facilities? Product bundle pricing Product bundle pricing combines several of their products and offer the bundle at a reduced price. Telecommunication companies, such as SingTel in Singapore, offer bundle pricing by giving discounted rates when customers subscribe to several of its services—mobile phone, cable, and Internet connections. Combines serveral products at a reduced price To promote the sales of products consumers might not otherwise buy, but the combined price must be low enough to get them to buy the bundle. Price Adjustment Strategies Segmented pricing Segmented pricing is used when a company sells product with the same cost at two or more prices.\na) Customer-segment pricing\nWhen different customers pay different prices for the same product or service. b) Product-form pricing\nWhen different versions of the product are priced differently but not according to differences in cost. c) Location-based pricing\nWhen the product is sold in different geographic areas and priced differently in those areas even though the cost is the same. Psychological pricing Psychological pricing occurs when sellers consider the psychology of prices and not simply the economics. The price is used to “say something” about the product.\nReference prices are prices that buyers carry in their minds and refer to when looking at a given product. Noting current prices Remembering past prices Assessing the buying situations Promotional pricing Promotional pricing is when prices are temporarily priced below list price or cost to increase demand.\na. Loss leaders\nProducts sold below cost to attract customers in the hope they will buy other items at normal markups. b. Special event pricing\nUsed to attract customers during certain seasons or periods. c. Cash rebates\nGiven to consumers who buy products within a specified time. Price Adjustment Strategies\nRisks of promotional pricing\nUsed too frequently, no excitement and create “deal-prone” Copies by competitors can create “deal-prone” customers who will wait for promotions and avoid buying at regular price. Creates price wars. DISCUSSION\nIn the era of digital marketing, is dynamic pricing (e.g., personalized pricing based on user data, real-time demand, or geolocation) fair? How should businesses balance profit maximization with consumer trust? Price Changes Initiating and reacting to price cuts and price increase.

Makes narrow assortments of products in large quantities Wants broad assortments of products in small quantities Buys large quantities from many producers and break them down into smaller quantities and broader assortments wanted by consumers Intermediaries offer the firm more than it can achieve on its own through their contacts, experience, specialization, and scale of operations.\nFrom an economic view, intermediaries transform the assortment of products into assortments wanted by consumers.\nFunctions of Marketing Channel Members Completing Transactions\nInformation gathering and distributing marketing research and intelligence information about actors and forces in the marketing environment needed for planning and aiding exchange. Promotion Promotion refers to the development and spreading persuasive communications about an offer. Contacts Contacts refers to finding and communicating with prospective buyers. Matching\nMatching shaping and fitting the offer to the buyer’s needs Physical distribution transporting and storing goods Negotiation reaching an agreement on price and other terms of the offer so that ownership or possession can be transferred Number of Channel Members Channel level refers to each layer of marketing intermediaries that performs some work in bringing the product and its ownership closer to the final buyer.\nIndirect marketing channels contain one or more intermediaries.\nFrom the producer’s point of view, a greater number of levels mean less control and greater channel complexity.\nA direct marketing channel has no intermediary levels; the company sells directly to consumers.\nFor example, Avon and Amway sell their products door to door, through home and office sales parties, and on the Web.\nChannel Behavior and Organization Channel Behaior Channel conflict refers to disagreement over goals, roles, and rewards by channel members. Horizontal conflict conflict among members at the same channel level. Vertical conflict conflict between different levels of the same channel. Multichannel Distribution Systems Multichannel distribution system (Hybrid marketing channels) exist when a single firm sets up two or more marketing channels to reach one or more customer segments. Changing Channel Organizations Disintermediation is that producers cut out intermediaries and go directly to final buyers, or when radically new types of channel intermediaries / new forms of resellers displace traditional ones.\nChanges in technology and the explosive growth of online marketing offer a new form of reselling (non-store retailing), replacing traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.\nChannel Design Decisions Number of Marketing Intermediaries Companies must also determine the number of channel members to use at each level. Three strategies are available:\nIntensive Distribution Stocking the product in as many outlets as possible. These products must be available where and when consumers want them. Ideal for low involvement, convenience products. Exclusive Distribution The producer gives only a limited number of dealers the exclusive right to distribute its products in their territories to enhance the brand image and gain stronger retail support. Ideal for high involvement, specialty products. Luxury goods, automobile, designer labels etc. Selective Distribution Selective distribution is between intensive and exclusive distribution, a producer uses more than one but fewer than all of the intermediaries willing to carry the producer’s products. Ideal for high involvement, shopping products. Marketing Promotion Intergrated Marketing Communtions Promotion Mix Main Promotional Tools Sales Promotion refers to short-term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of products and services. Coupons Demonstrations Displays …… Personal Selling refers to product introductions and personal presentations made by sales personnel for the purpose of achieving sales and building customer relationships.

Advertising objectives can be categorized by their primary purpose.\nInform Persuade Remind Informative advertising is primarily used during the introduction stage of new products, with the objective of building primary demand. Persuasive advertising is crucial for increasing selective demand for established, competitive brands. Reminder advertising is important during the maturity stage of a product; it helps maintain customer relationships and keeps consumers thinking about the product. Product Life-cycle Strategies Product life cycle (PLC) is the course that a product’s sales and profits take over its lifetime\nProduct development Introduction Growth Maturity Decline PLC can describe a product class, a product form (Fuel-powered Vehicle, Electric Vehicle) or a brand.\nProduct Development Stage Begins when the company develops a new-product idea Sales are zero Investment

你真的知道\n我人生中最应该优先考虑的是什么吗？ 你真的在意我吗？\n是你吗？ 妈妈？\n所以最后还是你吗？\n还是爸爸呢？ 是哪个我很重要的亲人吗？ 还是路上哪个根本不认识的路人呢？\n那个失望的，鄙夷的，警惕的 我臆想中的眼神 那个嘲弄的，冷漠的，尖酸的\n我臆想中的声音\n到底来自哪里？ 你到底是谁？ 我真的见过你吗？ 如果我见过你 为什么你的面目如此模糊 如果我没有见过你 为什么你的声音和意见如此强硬？\n如果—— 我剃了寸头 我就能找出那些阻止我声音的源头了吗？ 我会找到你 还是会发现你根本不存在呢？\n如果你存在 如果你确实存在\n我想要问问你 我真的想要问问你 如果——\n我剃了寸头\n我就不是我了吗？\n我\n我这个人存在\n在这个世界上的唯一标准\n是我是否具有长长的头发吗？\n如果你真的这么在意我的头发\n你愿意花多少来收购呢？\n收长头发的价格\n好像一般比收废品的要高一些\n但根据理发师的判断\n我的头发细软枯黄\n营养不良\n应该价格和废品一样\n大概3块钱一斤\n显然我的头发一斤都没有\n你那么珍视的，在意的我的头发\n好不值钱呀\n你要不要考虑换个东西去在意啊\n比如金价\n比如房价\n比如……算了\n有太多一些我说出来\n你又不高兴了的东西\n你看——\n即使没有了长长的头发\n我的心还是那么善良

2025年3月24日，我走进了理发店，这一次我没有选择自己理发（手艺实在不精，也或是天气的燥热让我不能再忍受更久了），距离上次我自己理发已经过去了整整两个月了，最长的头发已经有足足3cm了。出门晚了，我让理发师剃了熟悉的9mm，仅仅用了15min，就完成了这次剃头。\n数数日子，距离我想剃寸头已经三年了，距离我剃了寸头过去了两年。我有些后悔自己没有早点开始，后悔自己曾经浪费了太多时间。\n我不止一次感叹，我喜欢我的身体，我越来越喜欢我的身体。\n更重要的是，我全然收回了自己的知觉能力。每一刻，都可以是对外在环境的感受和对内心各种丰富情绪的敏锐觉察和捕捉。而不是把所有注意力都放在时刻担心自己的外表是否得体和举止是否优雅上。我可以享受风吹过头皮的瞬间，享受毛孔的自在呼吸。\n我命令风穿过发间的荒原\n让每一寸头皮在呼啸中苏醒\n不是风在抚摸我\n是我在驯服风的形状——\n它跪伏成梳齿\n我昂起头颅\n整片天空便成了我的冠冕\n我突然间明白，原来男性一直处在一个如此便利的生活中。\n可是，到底是谁规定了这样的审美?是谁规定了通过头发长短，衣着的修身程度来区分女性和男性?为什么男性能够将这样一种如此便利的生活方式以文化的形式占为已有?为什么辛亥革命只有男性剪掉了辫子，因为他们知道辫子的累赘。\n简单的、习以为常的表象之后是权力关系的博弈。当女性以为自己生来便喜欢长发、化妆、超短裙、白幼瘦时，这种“喜欢”的背后又是由什么权力关系塑造?这些问题我很喜欢反复询问自己，心中也早有答案。\n从那以后，我不再为美丽工业投掷金钱，没有了各式各样化妆品，我省下大笔钱投入到自己喜欢的事情，和自我规划发展中。\n人一旦体验过舒适的生活方式，就不会再回到从前的不舒适中。\n就像剪寸头，尝试过后便只有一次和无数次。\n","date":"2025-03-31T02:25:34+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%A4%B4%E7%9A%AE%E6%97%A5%E8%AE%B0-%E4%B8%8E%E9%A3%8E%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E7%9A%84365%E5%A4%A9/title_hu_8a1eec68609d21bb.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%A4%B4%E7%9A%AE%E6%97%A5%E8%AE%B0-%E4%B8%8E%E9%A3%8E%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E7%9A%84365%E5%A4%A9/","title":"头皮日记

Pharmacies in China are an integral part of the healthcare system, tasked with dispensing medications in accordance with strict regulatory standards. While their physical appearance may resemble that of other retail stores, pharmacies operate under specific laws that differentiate them. Many medications, particularly prescription drugs, cannot be sold without a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Even with a prescription, there are often limits on the quantity of drugs a customer can purchase. These regulations are designed to ensure the safe and responsible distribution of medications.\nIn addition to prescription verification, pharmacists in China are required to perform thorough background checks on customers, including reviewing their medical history. This helps ensure that patients are not involved in drug abuse and prevents harmful drug interactions. As a result, pharmacy management systems play a crucial role in ensuring compliance with these regulations. These systems facilitate the tracking of prescriptions, managing medication limits, and maintaining accurate customer records, all of which contribute to patient safety and efficient pharmacy operations.\nWith this project, our aim is to develop a comprehensive system that could deal with challenges faced in day to day operation of a modern pharmacy.\nEntities Coutomer When a customer arrives in the pharmacy, we identify them based on their PIN (Personal Identification Number). If they are a new customer, they are asked for their name, date of birth, phone number, gender and address.\nInsurance In China, as of 2023, the basic medical insurance coverage rate remains stable at over 95% (National Healthcare Security Administration data). The wide - spread coverage is mainly due to the continuous improvement and popularization of the national basic medical insurance system, which includes the urban employee basic medical insurance, the urban and rural residents\u0026rsquo; basic medical insurance. The high coverage is crucial because medical expenses can be relatively large for some serious diseases and treatments. Without insurance, many people may face financial difficulties in affording necessary medical services.\nIf a customer has health insurance, we store the insurance ID (unique for each customer), start date, end date and Co-Insurance. Co-Insurance is a percentage amount that insurance company pays for a medicinal purchase. Given the customer PIN and insurance ID, the system should be able to automatically calculate the amount paid by medical insurance fund and customer.\nEmployees An employee has same details as a customer but they are also given a company ID, that is unique for them. An employee has to have one of the following roles:\nPharmacist CPhT (Certified Pharmacy Technician) Intern (can work in the pharmacy part time) Cashier Apart from pharmacy cashiers, all personnel directly involved in drug dispensing and preparation are required to obtain professional qualification certificates issued by the National Medical Products Administration.\nPrescription Most of the drugs in the pharmacy can only be sold with a prescription. A prescription contains customer’s PIN, the prescribing Doctor’s ID (required by law) and when the prescription was prescribed. Each prescription contains a number of prescribed drugs with drug name, quantity and refill limit of each of them.\nPrescription Drug Prescription drugs can only be dispensed with a valid doctor\u0026rsquo;s prescription. They\u0026rsquo;re more potent and regulated strictly. Prescription Drug is represented in the system with a unique identifier, PresplD. This helps in precisely tracking each individual prescription - related drug record. The DrugName clearly states the name of the medication, which can be either the generic or brand name. PrespQty indicates the quantity of the drug that has been prescribed for the customer. This is an important detail as it affects how much of the drug is dispensed. RefillLimit defines the number of times the customer can get a refill for this particular drug based on the original prescription.\nOrder An order is created from the prescription. This data has to be stored separately because customer may:\nBuy less medicine than prescription specifies Come back for refills based on same prescription Each order has a unique Order ID that is automatically assigned by the system. Each order can have multiple drugs, each with their ordered quantity and price. We also record batch number of the drug.\nOrdered Drugs Ordered drugs are selected by customers per prescription or OTC needs. The system records drug name, quantity (which may differ from prescription), price, and links them to a unique Order ID. For prescription - based orders, it cross - references prescription details for compliance.\nBill Once an order has been completed, a bill is generated by the system. This bill is handed over to the customer and contains order information, insurance information as well as breakdown of amount paid. The breakdown should be automatically calculated by the system based on insurance, customer and medicine data.\nMedicine (Inventory) Drugs are divided into \u0026ldquo;over-the-counter drugs\u0026rdquo; (OTC drugs), \u0026ldquo;prescription drugs\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;controlled drugs\u0026rdquo;. For all types of drugs, especially prescription drugs and controlled drugs, pharmaceutical institutions and medical facilities are legally obligated to maintain accurate and up-to-date inventory records. This is not only for the purpose of record - keeping but also to effectively manage stock levels. Timely inventory management helps to ensure the continuous availability of necessary drugs while also preventing overstocking or shortages. OTC drugs, on the other hand, are more accessible to the public but still need to be sold and inventoried in accordance with relevant regulations to guarantee their quality and proper supply.\nDisposal Drugs are marked for disposal when expired, damaged, or in case of controlled drugs following medical regulations. Once disposed, inventory records are updated. The system then generates a disposal record, which includes the drug name, the batch number of the drug, the name of the company that produced the drug, and the dispensed quantity.\nNotifications The system should be able to generate notifications based on the following four events:\nStock for a medicine is low (less than 100 tablets) Some medicine will expire in next 60 days Drugs are marked for disposal Drugs are successfully disposed The notifications are sent to all the employees who are Pharmacists.\nER Modeling ER Diagram Logical Data Model Diagram ","date":"2025-03-20T21:25:06+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E8%8D%AF%E6%88%BF%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/pharmacy_hu_9232b17c80a5c985.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E8%8D%AF%E6%88%BF%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/","title":"药房数据库管理系统"},{"content":"Physical Database Design Intro to physical database design Database Building (Physical Design)\nBuild the database and write application programs Purpose\ntranslate the logical description of data into the technical specifications for storing and retrieving data using a specific DBMS Goal\ncreate a design for storing data that will provide adequate performance and ensure database integrity, security, and recoverability MySQL database structure A MySQL database consists of multiple user accounts A user account can contain different databases Also called database schemas Physical design process Field, data type, and index Dsigning fields What is field?\nsmallest unit of application data recognized by system software Field design considerations\nChoosing data type Coding, compression, encryption Controlling data integrity Naming rules for tables and fields 1 to 64 characters long\nCan contain letters, numbers, or underscores\nCan’t contain certain symbols and keywords\nEvery table in your database must have a unique name\nEvery field in a table must have a unique name\nCase sensitivity (in MySQL):\nKeywords: No Table and Columns/Fields name: No (exception: Linux) Purpose\nSpecify internal encoding Optimize internal storage use Provide error checking mechanisms Datatypes in different database may be slightly different\nMain data types in MySQL Text data types\nCHAR VARCHAR Number data types\nIntegers: INT and variations Floating point numbers: DECIMAL, FLOAT Dates \u0026amp; times\nDATE, TIME, and variations Character: Use an appropriate character data type for all fields that are not numbers or dates\nNames, addresses, etc. Postal codes, telephone numbers, social security numbers Numeric\nSurrogate keys 代理键 (primary key ID values) All numeric data you might use in a calculation (prices, quantities, etc.) CHAR data type\nFor fixed-width character fields (1 – 255 characters) Fields in which you know the exact number of characters Pads out the remaining characters with blank spaces Removes the trailing blank spaces when data is retrieved VARCHAR data type\nFor variable-width character fields (1-255 characters) Number of characters varies for individual data values Values are not padded with blank spaces CHAR or VARCHAR?\nUse CHAR when the sizes of the column data entries are consistent Use VARCHAR when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably Use VARCHAR(MAX) when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably, and the string length might exceed 8,000 bytes Q\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; But if VARCHAR is so efficient in handling the space management dynamically based on the content being stored, why databases has the support for CHAR datatype, all CHAR(n) fields can be VARCHAR(n) fields, right ? \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A CHAR fields require less string manipulation because of fixed field widths, index lookups against CHAR field are on average 20% faster than that of VARCHAR fields.

For example, we want to find out the offering that a professor teaches? Data sources are fragmented To get a comprehensive view of a scenario Uncover interesting patterns Combine information from two tables Form pairs of related rows from two tables where the matching columns (recall: FK) in each of the two tables have the same value To perform a join Simply list more than one table name in the FROM clause, using a comma as a separator, and FROM offering, faculty Typically use a WHERE clause to specify the join conditions WHERE offering.FacSSN = faculty.FacSSN Alias An alias can be used for a table named in the FROM clause, where the alias is separated from the table name with a space e.g., FROM offering O, faculty F Can two different tables have the same alisa? When can an alias be used? Used to qualify a column name whenever there is ambiguity regarding the source of the column name e.g., WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN Also used as a shorthand notation for the table name An alias can be used anywhere in place of the table name Example Example: Two-table joining\nQ1: list the OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName for fall 2002 IS courses taught by assistant professors, and order results by FacLastName (ASC) and CourseNo (DESC)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM offering O, faculty F WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN AND FacRank = \u0026#39;ASST\u0026#39; AND CourseNo LIKE \u0026#39;IS%\u0026#39; AND OffTerm = \u0026#39;FALL\u0026#39; AND OffYear = 2002 ORDER BY FacLastName, CourseNo DESC; Example: Three-table joining\nQ2: List Leonard Vince’s teaching schedule in fall 2002. For each course, list the offering number, course number, number of units, days, location, and time.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 SELECT OfferNo, O.CourseNo, CrsUnits, OffDays, OffLocation, OffTime FROM faculty F, course C, offering O WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN AND O.CourseNo = C.CourseNo AND OffYear = 2002 AND OffTerm = \u0026#39;FALL\u0026#39; AND FacFirstName = \u0026#39;Leonard\u0026#39; AND FacLastName = \u0026#39;Vince\u0026#39; Summarization in multiple tables\nPowerful combination List join conditions in the WHERE clause Q3: List the number of students enrolled for each 2003 offering.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT offering.OfferNo, COUNT(*) AS NumStudents FROM enrollment E, offering O WHERE E.OfferNo = O.OfferNo AND OfferYear = 2003 GROUP BY O.OfferNo Different types of JOIN Inner Join and Outer Join List all the offerings and the information about their instructors 1 2 3 SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM offering O, faculty F WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN We have 13 offerings in Offering tables but only see 11 offerings in the result. Why? New demand for Join We need another operator for the item that have a match, it behaves like a Join but for the items that have NO MATCH, it appends the record with NULLs The operators with these properties are called outer joins. (There are several of them) The operators that we studied already are also called inner joins (To distinguish them from outer joins) (Inner/Natural) Join excludes non matching rows Preserving non matching rows is important in some problems Outer join variations Full outer join 全外连接 One-sided outer join 单边外连接 JOIN and INNER JOIN Use INNER/FULL/LEFT/RIGHT JOIN and ON keywords in the FROM clause INNER JOIN = JOIN Mixing Inner and Outer Join Combine columns from the Faculty, Offering, and Course tables for IS Courses (list OfferNo, CourseNo, OffTerm, CrsDesc, FacSSN, FacLastName). Including a row in the result even if there is not an assigned instructor.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT OfferNo, offering.CourseNo, OffTerm, CrsDesc, faculty.FacSSN, FacLastName FROM ( faculty RIGHT JOIN offering ON offering.FacSSN = faculty.FacSSN) INNER JOIN course ON course.courseNo = offering.courseNo WHERE course.CourseNo LIKE \u0026#39;IS%\u0026#39; Structured Query Language Part 3 How to write nested queries Type 1 nested queries Retrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students.\nQuery inside q query Use in WHERE and HAVING conditions Executes one time No reference to outer query Also known as non-correlated or independent nested query 1 2 3 4 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE FacSSN NOT IN (SELECT StdSSN FROM student ); Type 2 nested queries Similar to nested loops Executes one time for each row of outer query Reference to outer query Also known as correlated or variably nested query Retrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM student WHERE student.StdSSN = faculty.FacSSN ); Type 2 nested query animation Alternative Outer Join with Only Nonmatching Rows\nRetrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students. 1 2 3 4 5 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty LEFT JOIN student ON faculty.FacSSN = student.StdSSN WHERE student.StdSSN IS NULL; Can we use Inner Join?\n1 2 3 SELECT DISTINCT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty, student WHERE student.StdSSN \u0026lt;\u0026gt; faculty.FacSSN; Difference problems cannot be solved with inequality joins there is at least one student row that does not match every faculty row.\nOther use cases List the first name of faculty who has the highest salary.\n1 2 SELECT FacFirstName, MAX(FacSalary) FROM faculty 1 2 3 SELECT FacFirstName, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE FacSalary = (SELECT MAX(FacSalary) FROM faculty) We want to know the total amount of faculty’s highest salary for each department.\n1 2 3 4 SELECT SUM(MaxSalary) FROM(SELECT FacDept, Max(FacSalary) AS MaxSalary FROM faculty GROUP BY FacDept) AS tmp1 Write and Edit Data Data manipulation language Query(read-only) SELECT: to query data in the database Update(write) INSERT: inserts new rows of data into a table UPDATE: modifies existing data in a table DELETE: deletes rows of data from a table Attention: SQL uses the reserved keyword UPDATE to mean \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo; specifically. However, the term \u0026ldquo;update\u0026rdquo; is also used to refer to the three operations Insert a Single Row Format of INSERT statement INSERT INTO TableName[(columnList)] VALUES (dataValueList) columnList A list of one or more column names separated by commas Optional If omitted, SQL assumes all columns in order If specified, any columns that are omitted from the list are assumed to have NULL values dataValueList must match columnList Have same number of items Have direct correspondence in the position of items in the two lists Data type must be compatible INSERT Example Insert a row into the Student table supplying values for all columns.\n1 2 3 4 5 INSERT INTO student (StdSSN, StdFirstName, StdLastName, StdCity, StdState, StdZip, StdClass, StdMajor, StdGPA) VALUES (\u0026#39;999999999\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;JOE\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;STUDENT\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;SEATAC\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;WA\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;98042-1121\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;FR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;IS\u0026#39;, 0.0) Web crawler + INSERT Scrapy - How to crawl website \u0026amp; store data in Microsoft SQL Server database?\n1 2 3 self.cursor.execute(\u0026#34;INSERT INTO MYTABLE(text, author, tags) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\u0026#34;, (item[\u0026#39;text\u0026#39;], item[\u0026#39;author\u0026#39;], item[\u0026#39;tags\u0026#39;])) UPDATE Statement Formate of UPDATE statement 1 2 3 UPDATE TableName SET columnName1 = dataValue1 [, columnName2 = dataValue2 …] [WHERE searchCondition]; Processing order: UPDATE→WHERE→SET SET clause: specifies the names of one or more columns that are to be updated WHEREclause is optional If omitted, all rows are updated for the named columns If specified, only those rows that satisfy the searchCondition are updated dataValue(s): must have compatible data type(s) for the corresponding column(s) UPDATE Example Change the major and class of Homer Wells.\n1 2 3 UPDATE student SET StdMajor = \u0026#39;ACCT\u0026#39;, StdClass = \u0026#39;SO\u0026#39; WHERE StdFirstName = \u0026#39;HOMER\u0026#39; AND StdLastName = \u0026#39;WELLS\u0026#39; DELETE Statement Format of DELETE statement 1 2 DELETE FROM TableName [WHERE searchCondition]; WHERE clause is optional If omitted, all rows are deleted from the table; however, this doesn’t delete the table itself (i.e., table’s column names are still there).

AND StdClass = \u0026#39;SR\u0026#39; Query Evaluation and Efficiency Tips for developing queries Be familiar with the data model (entities and relationships) Review ERD Understand the desired results Know the attributes desired in result Identify the entities that contain desired attributes Use LIMIT and TOP to get an overview of a table Fine tune with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses if needed Consider the effect on unusual data Query efficiency considerations Instead of SELECT *, identify the specific attributes in the SELECT clause; this helps reduce network traffic of result set Try to make everything done in a single query if possible Limit the number of subquery If data is to be used many times, make a separate query and store it as a view Guidelines for better query design Understand how indexes are used in query processing Keep optimizer statistics up-to-date Use compatible data types for fields and literals Break complex queries into multiple simple parts Create temporary tables for groups of queries Combine update operations Consider the total query processing time for ad hoc queries Structured Query Language Part 4 View SQL View is a virtual table that is constructed from other tables or views It has no data of its own, but obtains data from tables or other views It only has a definition Views can be used as regular tables in SELECT statements CREATE VIEW Command 1 2 3 CREATE VIEW faculty_name_view AS SELECT FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM faculty; To see the view use: 1 2 SELECT * FROM faculty_name_view Uses for SQL Views Display results of computations Hide complicated SQL syntax Provide a level of isolation between actual data and the user’s view of data three-tier architecture: database -\u0026gt; application -\u0026gt; client Security: hide columns and rows Assign different processing permissions to different views on same table Assign different triggers to different views on same table PostgreSQL and SQL Server allows it, but MySQL does not allow it Triggers and Routines Triggers- execute in response to a database event (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) Routines - Program modules that execute on demand Procedures routines that do not return values directly can be used in subsequent SQL statements take input or output parameters Functions routines that return values take input parameters Triggers vs. Routines Triggers Trigger: stored program that is executed by the DBMS whenever a specified event occurs Associated with a table Three basic trigger types: BEFORE, INSTEAD OF, and AFTER In DML trigger, each type can be declared for INSERT, UPDATE, and/or DELETE Resulting in a total of 9 trigger types Database triggers can be used to perform any of the following:\nAudit data modification Log events transparently Implement complex security authorizations Derive column values automatically Maintain replicate tables Create Trigger\n1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} {INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE} ON table_name FOR EACH ROW \u0026lt;triggered SQL statement here\u0026gt;;

Summary What is view and the advantage of using views How to write Trigger, Procedure, and Function NoSQL and MongoDB NoSQL Introduction What is NoSQL? Stands for \u0026ldquo;Not Only SQL\u0026rdquo; Non-relational data storage systems Supports unstructured format (no fixed schema) Well-suited for applications that deal with unstructured or semi structured data, such as social media, IoT devices, and e-commerce platforms Categories of NoSQL Document Store\nStores data using JSON, BSON documents Example: MongoDB, Couchbase Key-Value Data Store Stores data in unique key-value pairs Example: Dynamo, Redis Column Database Uses flat structure, but with keys stored in columns rather than rows Example: Cassandra, Hbase Graph Database Uses edges and nodes to represent and store data Example: Neo4j, JanusGraph RDBMS vs NoSQL How to pick?\nNature of data Row/column (structured) Unstructured, complex data which needs nesting Schema Static: RDBMS, Dynamic: NoSQL Flexibility of query RDBMS: Joins allow for flexibility NoSQL: Duplication of data, implement joins in middle - ware Data integrity RDBMS provide stronger consistency and integrity guarantees Handling “Big” data with better performance RDBMS normalization and joins are powerful, but add up in cost NoSQL databases are optimized for read and write operation MongoDB MongoDB is Created by 10gen (term derived from humongous) an open source, document-oriented database designed stores BSON (JSON-like) documents Schema-less MongoDB was founded in 2007 by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz and Kevin Ryan the team behind DoubleClick JSON JavaScript Object Notation\nPlain text file Organized as objects within braces { } Uses key-value pairs keys are field names; strings in quotes values are the data; strings, numbers, Boolean (quotes around strings required) a comma separates the key-value pairs 1 2 key: value \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C-3P0\u0026#34; Values can be any lenth MongoDB\nThe easiest way to get started with MongoDB is MongoDB Atlas. Atlas is MongoDB\u0026rsquo;s fully managed database-as-a-service. MongoDB has an Aggregation Framework. Aggregation Tab\nAggregation tap allows us to create pipeline stages, which specifies multiple stages of queries, to return a subset of documents from collection. Query in NoSQL NoSQL is new to us!\nLet’s make some comparisons between NoSQL operations and the SQL commands How to do SELECT, WHERE, SORT, GROUP BY in NoSQL? Return the Specified Fields $project $project: {name: 1, beds: 1, bedrooms: 1, price:1} The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement 1 SELECT name, bed_type, bedrooms FROM… The _id field is, by default, included in the output documents. You can remove by setting the field to 0.\nSpecify Equality Condition $match stage filters the documents to pass only the documents that match the specified condition(s) $match $match: {bedrooms: 3} $match corresponds to the following SQL statement: 1 SELECT… FROM … WHERE bedrooms = 3 Specify Conditions Using Operators Syntax: $match: { : { : }, ... } For example $match: { price: { $gt: 200 } } corresponds to the following SQL statement: 1 2 SELECT * FROM airbnb WHERE price \u0026gt; 200; Sore Results Using $sort stage, we can specify the sort order of the returned documents $sort: { price: 1 } The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement 1 SELECT * FROM airbnb ORDER By price ASC; We can set the field to 1 (-1), to specify ascending (descending) order for a field.\nAggregation $group documents by some specified expression and outputs to the next stage a document for each distinct grouping Syntax $group: {_id:\u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;field\u0026gt;:{\u0026lt;accumulator1\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;expression1\u0026gt;}, ...} group: {_id:\u0026quot;$beds\u0026quot;, avgprice: {$avg: \u0026quot;$price\u0026quot;}} corresponds to the following SQL statement 1 2 3 SELECT beds, avg(price) as airbnb FROM airbnb Group by beds; Summary What is NoSQL and when to use it How to write NoSQL queries Future Trends in Database Large Language Models and Database Questions\nHave you used AI tools to help with database design \u0026amp; SQL queries? How was your experience? Good or bad? LLM Sophisticated deep learning models that predicts what word comes next for any piece of text How LLMs learn Limitations of LLM\nHallucination: LLMs may confidently give wrong info Lack of real-time or proprietary knowledge Limited reasoning or symbolic logic Poor at tasks requiring up-to-date, precise, or secure data access Databases enhance LLM-RAG\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM + database = smart, grounded answers. Examples: Q\u0026amp;A Chatbot, Semantic search Main components (LangChain) Indexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline. Retrieval and generation: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. Using LLMs to Help Write SQL\nAsk a generic LLM apps to generate SQL queries without providing your db schema, you are unlikely to get correct queries It would be better if LLM apps know your database schema or can access your database Data Warehouse Challenges for modern organizations\nDrowning in data but starving for information Having the capability to collect and store data doesn’t mean using data wisely Fragmentation Data are from a variety of sources, including different hardware, software platforms, and applications Limited informational processing Most systems are developed to support operational processing, with little or no thought given to the information or analytical tools needed for decision making The need for data warehousing No single system of record Multiple systems are not synchronized A centralized repository can Integrates data from various systems/sources Synchronize data between systems Aggregate and clean data for analyses Data warehouse\nData warehouses consolidate and integrate information from many internal and external sources Arrange it in a meaningful format for making accurate and timely business decisions EIL in data warehouse Extract, transform, load (ETL) process for data warehousing Extract connecting to the data source, selecting the required data, and creating a copy of it Transform cleaning, filtering, and enriching the data to ensure that it is consistent and accurate Load creating tables, defining relationships, and inserting the data Advantages of data warehouse Improved data quality Data warehouses are designed to ensure data consistency and accuracy Better decision - making Provide decision - makers with easy access to large amounts of data Better performance Data warehouses are optimized for analytical queries, which improves query performance and enables faster data analysis Scalability Can handle large amounts of data, which enables them to scale as data volumes grow Data lake A data lake is a centralized repository that stores, processes, and secures large amounts of data in its native format, regardless of size Data lakes can accommodate all types of data, which is then used to power big

在冰岛，我坐在很大的邮轮上，波涛的海浪不停地翻腾，船颠簸地行驶着，感觉不到一丝寒冷，沉浸在海天一色中。\n我很喜欢刷手机，刷手机可以让我逃离现实无聊的世界，看到一个又一个有趣的帖子，犀利的发言，独到的观点，我会把这些放在收藏夹里，好似“收藏了就会了”，久而久之堆积成为“电子垃圾”。 在月记中，我专门记录一些我把刷手机的时间都放置在哪些具体的内容上了，也让这些时间不只为满足即刻的快感而浪费，发挥更大的价值。\n三月大事记 完成博客搭建 看了一场电影：《初步举证》 开始物品入库App: Find my stuff 整理全部物品件数 对生产的思考 To be a producer.\n成为一个生产者 让我对生产感到兴趣的是一句话。\n消费的快乐是比不上生产的快乐的。\n― （日）涩谷直人, 花小钱得自由 ——舍弃虚荣与钱包自在生活的50种方法 反消费主义 在我刚开始践行反消费主义时，我觉得不买无用的东西，只把钱花在要用的地方对我来说并不苦难。但是我感到非常拧巴，我得承认我觉得当我去消费购买一件物品时，这件物品是不是我需要的，消费这个过程是会让人感到快乐的，这是无法否认的。这句话似乎给了我答案，需要承认消费是带来快乐的，但快乐也可以通过生产产生，通过生产产生的快乐也将会是一种更意义的快乐。\n对女人来说,既然一样都要忍受,她们宁愿忍受生活单调无聊，也不愿忍受冒险之苦，她们比较容易从家里汲取微薄的幸福，而不容易从路上奔波赴险获得。对这样的女人，她们的命运维系在这些会变质腐败的东西上，一旦失去了这些东西，她们就等于失去了一切。只有自由的主体才能确立自我以超越时间，才能遏止变质腐败；但是女人是不准成为自由的主体的。但这主要是她从来没有体会到自由的力量，所以不相信自由解放；在她看来，这个世界是为幽昧不明的命运所支配,反抗命运是狂妄之举。走上追求自由的这几条危险道路,是别人强迫她去 做的,并不是她自己开辟出来的,也难怪她不会狂势地投入行动。\n― （法）西蒙·波伏娃, 第二性 女人可以藉着工作，大大拉近她和男人的距离；唯有工作能让她拥有具体的自由。她一旦不再寄生于男人，建立在她依附性上的整个系统就会坍塌；在她和这个世界之间，便不再需要男人做为中介。处于附庸地位的女人受到的诅咒是，她不许有任何作为，所以她才会殷殷切切地藉着自恋的表现,或藉着爱情、宗教追寻自我的存在而落得徒劳无功；但在她成为生产者、主动者之后，便能重新赢得自己的存在超越性；她以行动投入自己构思的人生时，便具体确立了自己是主体；她在承担了自己追求的目标、承担了属于自己的金钱和权利时，便体认到自己的责任。就算她从事的职业卑微，许多女人都很清楚自己会从工作中得到好处。\n― （法）西蒙·波伏娃, 第二性 但在她成为生产者、主动者之后，便能重新赢得自己的存在超越性。\n波伏娃在《第二性》中也提到了，赢得存在超越性的前提是成为生产者。\n杂谈 向前看 女性主义者真的是在霸凌和牺牲普通女性吗？ 不纠结于无意义的问题\n在文明社会里，面子是很重要的，比起真的吃亏，大部分人更不愿意被人看到自己吃亏。更有甚者，宁可吃了亏充面子，也不愿意不吃亏但被人觉得丢脸。所以你指出来她们吃了亏，那对她们来说就是十恶不赦。为什么男人反而不在乎呢，因为你指出男人是得利者，并没有伤害男人的面子，只有想结婚但结不了婚的男人会因为潜在利益受损而不高兴。别说是素昧平生的网友，就算是现实生活中的亲人朋友，你掏心掏肺劝人家结婚是赔本生意，人家也是要跟你翻脸的。\n那些骂“女权迫害女人”的娇妻，本质是被父权驯化的家禽啄食同类——自己吃着泔水还要骂野狼撕咬铁笼！她们把婚姻当子宫贷，还妄想用三从四德绑架全体女性当人质？真分裂女性的明明是婚恋市场的ABCD打分表，是牌坊精们把子宫当投名状的内卷！她们骂街时，骂的是提灯笼的人，还是不敢承认天早就亮了？省省吧，牌坊精，裹脚布臭到2025年了！\n谈觉醒 就我个人的体验来说其实觉醒了真的很快乐 在呼唤“女性觉醒”的时代，只要你感觉是快乐的，不觉醒也没关系。\n反驳\n往斜坡上丢一个小球，它也会自动地滚落，而且它最终一定会自愿地滚到坡底，哪怕它不自愿，斜坡也会帮它资源，这个斜坡就是社会结构，而你就是那个资源下滑的小球。\n如果一句话不能对一个国家说，那也不能对一个女人说：\n百年前，中国人说自己想屹立于世界民族之林会被嘲笑。百年后，中国人说自己想变成东亚病夫还是会被嘲笑。听自己的声音，别听流行。\n在呼喊外争国权内惩国贼的年代，只要你感觉你是快乐的，割地赔款也没关系。\n觉醒 ≠ 痛苦\n觉醒的阵痛是因为你剜掉了那块一直被纱布保护着但却腐臭的烂肉。做手术的过程当然很痛，但伤口会重新愈合，就可以重新走路了，就再也不需要那块“破纱布”了。\n任何鼓励“快乐堕落”的话术，都不叫自由，而是矫饰的陷阱。\n","date":"2025-03-13T21:43:49+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E4%B8%89%E6%9C%88-%E6%98%A5%E9%9B%A8%E5%A6%82%E4%B8%9D%E7%BB%87%E6%A2%A6%E6%9D%A5/plum_hu_fc0b0f5b0f3413b8.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E4%B8%89%E6%9C%88-%E6%98%A5%E9%9B%A8%E5%A6%82%E4%B8%9D%E7%BB%87%E6%A2%A6%E6%9D%A5/","title":"三月

Marketing is all around you… Even the fruit seller has to understand her market distribute her fruits at the right place sell them at the right price and be alert of who else are selling fruits or possible substitutes She has to make sure that she offers superior customer value What is marketing?\nMarketing is a process by which companies create value for customers and build strong customer relationships to capture value from customers in return. Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational goals. The Marketinig Process Understanding the Marketplace and Customer Needs Customer Needs, Wants, and Demands Needs are states of deprivation Physical - food, clothing, warmth, safety Social - belonging and affection Individual - Knowledge and self-expression Wants are the form that needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality Demands are wants backed by buying power You need to be able to communicate with your friends \u0026amp; family. You need a mobile phone You may want to change a phone whenever a new model is released Your \u0026ldquo;want” backed by your power to buy a new phone become market demand Can marketers create demand?\nGood companies satisfy market demands, great companies create market demands! Market offering Market offerings are some combination of products, services, information, or experience offered to a market to satisfy a need or want.\nGoods Physical goods constitute the bulk of production and marketing efforts Services A growing portion of business activities are focused on the production of services The U.S. economy today consists of a 70–30 services to goods mix Persons Celebrity marketing is a major business Properties Intangible rights of ownership of either real property (real estate) or financial property (stock and bonds) Experiences By orchestrating several services and goods, a firm can create market experiences orchestrate v. 精心安排 Organizations Actively work to build a strong, favorable, and unique image in the minds of the target publics.

Question: Monks\u0026rsquo; demand for wooden combs Definition of Marketing Research We define marketing research as the systematic design, collection, analysis, and reporting of data and findings relevant to a specific marketing situation facing the company Qualitative Vs. Quantitative Research How to evaluate the service quality of a hotel? Different Objectives Qualitative\nTo uncover prevalent trends in thoughts and opinions To gain an understanding of underlying reasons and motivations To generate ideas and/or hypotheses for later quantitative research Quantitative\nTo quantify views and generalize results from a sample to the population of interest Sometimes followed by qualitative research which is used to explore some findings further Which one is better for marketing research? Quantitative Qualitative Strengths Provide data that is descriptive. Provides details about human behavior, emotion, and personality characteristics that quantitative studies cannot match. Control the influence of irrelevant variables, so as to discover the cause-and-effect relation of variables accurately. Weakness Provide no detail information for data interpretation. Less statistical power than quantitative study. Ignores the elements that can not be quantified. Differences in Method and Outcome Quantitative Qualitative Sample Usually a larger number of cases representing the population of interest. Usually a small number of non-representative cases. Random. Non-random. Data collection Survey, panel data, experiment, etc. Interview, observation, group discussion, etc. Data analysis Statistical. Non-statistical Findings Findings are usually conclusive and have good generalizability. Findings are not conclusive and cannot be used to make generalizations about the population of interest. The Marketing Research Process Define the problem and research objectives Example of a Research Brief\nAmericanAirlines (AA) is looking for new ways to serve its passengers It is reviewing many new ideas, especially to cater to its first-class passengers on very long flights, one idea was to provide an Internet connection on the flight Research objective: Whether to provide network access service during flight? How first-class passengers would respond to this service? The cost of this service? How much extra they would be willing to pay if a charge was made? Choice of first-class passenger\nWhat types of first-class passengers would respond to using an in flight Internet service?\nPrice level\nHow many first-class passengers will use the Internet service at different price levels?\nPreference of airline\nHow many extra first-class passengers might choose the Airlines because of the new service?\nPreference of WIFI service\nHow important is Internet service to first-class passengers relative to other services, such as a power plug or enhanced entertainment?\nDevelop the research plan Most commonly used research approaches in marketing\nObservation Fresh data can be gathered by observing the relevant actors and settings Consumers can be unobtrusively observed as they shop or as they consume products The Role of an observer Complete participant (going native) Part participant and part observer Complete observer Focus group Gathering 6 to 10 people carefully selected based on certain demographic, psychographic, or other considerations and brought together to discuss various topics of interest at length A professional research moderator provides questions based on the marketing managers\u0026rsquo; discussion guide or agenda In-depth Interview Open-ended, discovery-oriented method, which allows the interviewer to deeply explore the speaker\u0026rsquo;s feelings and perspectives on a subject This results in rich background information that can shape further questions relevant to the topic Types of interview Personal one-on-one interview Telephone interview Email Key Characteristics of Good In-depth Interview Open-ended Questions Questions need to be worded so that respondents talk about the topic, not just answer “yes” or “no” Seek Understanding and Interpretation It is important to use active listening skills to carefully interpret what the speaker is saying Open-minded Judgment or criticism can act as barriers to communication Flexible and Responsive Good interviewers can think on their feet, respond to challenges, and adjust their questions Patient Allow the respondent to speak freely and open up at a pace that is personally comfortable Survey Difference with interview? Companies undertake surveys to learn about people\u0026rsquo;s knowledge, beliefs, preferences, and satisfaction, and to measure these magnitudes using structured questions in the general population Usually involve a large sample size Research Approaches: Sampling issue A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population that represents a portion of the whole population There are three decisions that need to be made when designing a sample Sampling units - who or what is being surveyed Sample size - how many individuals should be surveyed Sampling procedure - how the sample should be selected Behavioral Research Customers leave traces of their purchasing behavior in store scanning data, catalog purchases, and online customer databases Advantages of behavioral data Actual purchases reflect consumers\u0026rsquo; preferences and often are more reliable than statements they offer to market researchers E.g., Customers may report preferences for popular brands, and yet the data show them actually buying other brands Technology has now advanced to such a degree that marketers can use devices such as eye-tracking, skin sensors, brain wave scanners, and full body scanners to get consumer responses Collect the information The data collection phase of marketing research is generally the most expensive and the most prone to error Professional data collection service is available Analyze the information The next-to-last step in the process is to extract findings from the collected data Various data analysis methods are available The researcher will also apply some advanced statistical techniques and decision models in the hope of discovering additional findings Present the findings The researcher presents findings relevant to the major marketing decisions facing management Make the decision The managers who commissioned the research need to weigh the evidence Good research should provide clear insights into the research problem Principles of Marketing (kotler Ch.3)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\nDescribe the environmental forces that affect the company’s ability to serve its customers Explain how changes in the demographic and economic environments affect marketing decisions Identify the major trends in the firm’s natural and technological environments Explain the key changes in the political and cultural environments Discuss how companies can react to the marketing environment Marketing environment The marketing environment includes the factors and forces outside marketing that shape opportunities and pose threats to the company.\nThe Company\u0026rsquo;s microenvironment The microenvironment consists of the factors close to the company that affect its ability to serve its customers, the company, suppliers, marketing intermediaries, customer markets, competitors, and publics.\nThe Company\nInternal environment includes:\nTop management Finance Research \u0026amp; Development Purchasing Operations Accounting Suppliers\nProvide the resources to produce goods and services Treated as partners to provide customer value Marketing Intermediaries\nHelp the company to promote, sell, and distribute its products to final buyers Resellers the distribution channel firms that help the company find customers or make sales to them.

Consumer behavior is the study of how individuals, groups, and organizations, select, buy, use, and dispose of goods, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy their needs and wants Importance of Understanding Customers\nWhy? The aim of marketing is to meet and satisfy target customers’ needs and wants better than competitors What? Model of Consumer Behavior Characteristics Affecting Consumer Behavior Marketers cannot control these factors but they must take them into account Cultural Factors Cultural factors have a broad and deep influence on consumer behavior. Marketers need to understand the role played by the buyer’s\nCulture Subculture Social class Culture is the learned values, perceptions, wants, and behaviors from family and other important institutions It is the broadest influence on consumers Cultural examples: individualism V.S. collectivism\nIndividualism (independent self) Care about self Establishes a person\u0026rsquo;s personal identity based on his or her personal achievements Emphasizes personal autonomy and self - realization Focuses on the right above his or her duties Collectivism (interdependent self) Group membership is the core aspect of identity Life satisfaction comes from the successful performance of social roles and obligations Promotionandprevention focus\nIndividualism\nPromotion focus\nFocus on positive aspects For example, exercise to keep healthy and look energetic Collectivism\nPrevention focus\nAvoid negative consequences For example, exercise to avoid weight gain Subcultures are groups of people within a culture with shared value systems based on common life experiences and situations\nThey include nationalities, religions , racial groups, and geographic regions\nSocial classes are society’s relatively permanent and ordered divisions whose members share similar values, interests, and behaviors\nUpper class Middle class Working class Lower class What indicates the social class? A cluster of variables: occupation, income, wealth, education, and value orientation etc Can you move up or down the social class ladder? Depends on how rigid the social stratification is in the society Marketing Implications of Social Classes\nSocial classes show distinct product and brand preferences in many areas, including clothing, home furnishings, leisure activities, and automobiles Social classes differ in media preferences, with upper-class consumers often preferring magazines and books, and lower-class consumers often preferring television. Even within a media category such as TV, upper-class consumers tend to prefer news and drama, and lower-class consumers tend to prefer soap operas and sports programs There are also language differences among the social classes. Advertising copy and dialogue must ring true to the targeted social class Social Factors Consumers do not make purchase decision on their own. A consumer’s behavior is often influenced by social factors including\nGroups and Social Networks Membership groups of which a consumer is officially a member Reference Groups are groups that serve as a comparison point we refer to in making a purchase aspirational groups trend setters opinion leaders Online social networks are online communities where people socialize or exchange information and opinions Family Family members can strongly influence buyer behavior Buyers vs Customrs Decision-makers vs Buying influences Family—Roles and Influence of Family Members\nMarketers are interested in the roles and relative influence of family members in the purchase of a large variety of products and services These roles vary widely in different countries and social classes Given women\u0026rsquo;s increasing wealth and income generating ability, household purchasing patterns are gradually changing in Asia Thus, marketers of products traditionally purchased by men are now thinking about women’s perceptions of such products Example – Focus on Women as Car Buyers\nKorean car makers are taking women more seriously as they represent 30% of domestic sales Hyundai introduced the Sonata Elegance Special, a female-oriented version of its flagship mid-sized sedan To provide a more feminine touch to its cars, Kia Motors focused on fashionable appearances Social Roles and Status the groups, family, clubs, and organizations to which a person belongs that can define role and social status Personal Factors A buyer’s decision is often influenced by personal demographic characteristics: Age and life - cycle stage Occupation Economic situation Lifestyle Personality and self - concept People change the goods and services they buy over different age and life-cycle stage. Marketers often define their targets in terms of life cycle stage and develop appropriate products and marketing plans for each stage. Occupation affects the goods and services bought by consumers A person\u0026rsquo;s economic situation will affect product decided and purchased. Marketers of income-sensitive goods should observe trends in: Personal income Savings Interest rates Lifestyle is a person’s pattern of living as expressed in his or her psychographics measured by a consumer’s AIOs (activities, interests, and opinions) to capture information about a person’s pattern of acting and interacting in the environment Personality and Self-Concept Personality refers to the unique psychological characteristics that lead to consistent and lasting responses to the consumer’s environment MATCH brand’s personality with YOURS Self-concept refers to people’s possessions that contribute to and reflect their identities Brand personality refers to the specific mix of human traits that may be attributed to a particular brand Consumers are likely to choose brands with personalities that match their own Psychological Factors A person’s psychological factors influence his/her daily behavior as well as buying choices. The four major psychological factors are:\nMotivation Perception Learning Beliefs and attitudes Key Psychological Processes\nThe starting point for understanding consumer behavior is the stimulus-response model Marketing and environmental stimuli enter the consumer’s consciousness A set of psychological processes combine with certain consumer characteristics to result in decision processes and purchase decisions What do marketers need to understand? Psychological Factors\nMotivation\nA motive is a need that is sufficiently pressing to direct the person to seek satisfaction Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains why people are driven by particular needs at particular times Psychological Needs Safety Needs Social Needs Esteem Needs Self-actualization Motivation research refers to qualitative research designed to probe consumers’ hidden, subconscious motivations Howdomarketers uncover deeper motives triggered by a product? In-depth interviews, word association, sentence completion, picture interpretation, and role-playing Perception is the process by which people select, organize, and interpret information to form a meaningful picture of the world from three perceptual processes\nSelective attention is the tendency for people to screen out most of the information to which they are exposed Selective distortion is the tendency for people to interpret information in a way that will support what they already believe Selective retention is the tendency to remember good points made about a brand they favor and to forget good points about competing brands Selective Attention: Some Findings\nPeople are more likely to notice stimuli that relates to a current need People are more likely to notice stimuli that they anticipate You are more likely to notice computers than radios in a computer store People are more likely to notice stimuli whose deviations are large in relation to the normal size of the stimuli Selective Distortion\nEven noticed stimuli don’t always come across in the way the senders intended Selective distortion is the tendency to interpret information in a way that fits our preconceptions Consumers will often distort information to be consistent with prior brand and product beliefs and expectations Marketing implications? Selective distortion can work to the advantage of marketers with strong brands when consumers distort neutral or ambiguous brand information to make it more positive Selective Distortion: Blind Taste Test\nTwo groups of people are invited to test the same product, with one group knowing which brand it is and the other group not When consumers report different opinions of branded and unbranded versions of identical products, it must be the case that their brand and product beliefs have somehow changed their product perceptions Selective Retention\nMost consumers don’t remember much of the information to which they are exposed, but they do retain information that supports their attitudes and beliefs Because of selective retention, consumers are likely to remember good points about a product they like and forget good points about competing products Marketing implications? Use repetition in marketing Learning is the changes in an individual’s behavior arising from experience Learning theory teaches marketers that they can build demand for a product by associating it with strong drives, using motivating cues, and providing positive reinforcement Case Analysis Shift, rather than accommodate, those existing social attitudes Created demand from nothing by associating their product with strong drives (internal emotion), enhancing stimuli and cues (celebrity wearing diamonds), and providing positive reinforcement (social status \u0026amp;romance) Belief is a descriptive thought that a person has about something based on knowledge, opinion or faith Attitudes describe a person’s relatively consistent evaluations, feelings, and tendencies toward an object or idea Types of Buying Decision Behavior High-Involvement Purchase Consumers are usually highly involved when there is high perceived risk in the purchase\nexpensive risky purchases infrequently highly self-expressive High involvement purchases lead to more active, careful decision making. The buyers will go through a learning process and the development of beliefs and 61 attitudes before a thoughtful purchase choice is made Low-Involvement Purchase Low involvement purchases are made as quickly and efficiently as possible because buyers do not pass through the usual belief-attitude behavior sequence Consumers usually have little involvement in the purchase of low-price and risk-free products. Consumers do not search extensively for information about the brands, evaluate brand characteristics, and make weighty decisions about which brands to buy Types of Buying Decision Behavior Types of consumer buying behavior based on the degree of buyer effort and the degree of differences among brands Complex Buying Behavior\nConsumers undertake complex buying behavior when they are highly involved in a purchase and perceive significant differences among brands. Typically, the consumer has much to learn about the product category. Purchasers are highly motivated when product is expensive, risky, purchased infrequently and highly self-expressive Marketers of high-involvement products must understand the information-gathering and evaluation behavior of high-involvement consumers\nDissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior\nDissonance-reducing buying behavior occurs when consumers are highly involved with an expensive, infrequent, or risky purchase, but see little difference among brands Post-purchase dissonance occurs when the consumer notices certain disadvantages of the product purchased or hears favorable things about a product not purchased To counter such dissonance, the marketer\u0026rsquo;s after-sale communications should provide evidence and support to help consumers feel good about their brand choices\nHabitual Buying Behavior\nHabitual buying behavior occurs when consumers have low involvement and there is little significant brand difference As buyers are not highly committed to any brands, marketers of low-involvement products with few brand differences often use price and sales promotions to stimulate buying\nVariety-Seeking Buying Behavior\nVariety-seeking buying behavior occurs when consumers have low involvement and there are significant brand differences. Customers often do a lot of brand switching to seek for variety Consumers often do a lot of brand switching Brand switching may occur because consumers want to try another brand out of boredom or simply to try something different, rather than because of dissatisfaction Variety-seeking buying behavior Market leader should try to encourage habitual buying by offering variety \u0026amp; running frequent reminder advertising Market challenger should encourage variety seeking by offering new variety, free samples or promotion The Buyer Decision Process Need Recognition Need recognition occurs when the buyer recognizes a problem or need triggered by:\nInternal stimuli External stimuli Information Search Information search is the amount of information needed in the buying process and depends on: The strength of the drive The amount of information you start with The ease of obtaining the information The value placed on the additional information The satisfaction from searching Commercial sources inform the buyer Personal sources evaluate products for the buyer Evaluation of Alternatives How the consumer processes information to arrive at brand choices Example of Attributes in Consumer Evaluation\nSharp’s Healsio, a steam oven, reduces the fat and salt in food while keeping its vitamin C. Sharp found that mothers with small children and elders with health needs were willing to spend more money to benefit from the added values of new products that would improve their health. However, in other parts of Asia, the concern is still more on price than product benefits. In North America and Europe, Healsio’s benefits are not so much its health qualities, but rather its convenience. It can double as a microwave oven, defroster, steamer, and grill. Evaluation of Alternatives: Beliefs and Attitudes\nThrough experience and learning, people acquire beliefs and attitudes, which in turn influence buying behavior Belief—a descriptive thought that a person holds about something Attitude—a person’s enduring favorable or unfavorable evaluation, emotional feeling, and action tendencies toward some object or idea Attitudes put people into a frame of mind: liking or disliking an object, moving toward or away from it Attitudes lead people to behave in a fairly consistent way toward similar objects Is attitude easy to change? Because attitudes economize on energy and thought, they can be very difficult to change A company is well-advised to fit its product into existing attitudes rather than to try to change attitudes Beliefs and Attitudes: Expectancy-Value Model\nThe consumer arrives at attitudes toward various brands through an attribute evaluation procedure, developing a set of beliefs about where each brand stands on each attribute Purchase Decision The purchase decision is the act by the consumer to buy the most preferred brand\nTwo factors can come between the purchase intention and the purchase decision Attitudes of others Unexpected situational factors Post-Purchase Decision The post-purchase decision is the satisfaction or dissatisfaction the consumer feels about the purchase. If the product falls short of expectations, the consumer is disappointed; if it meets expectations, the consumer is satisfied The larger the gap between expectation and performance, the greater the consumer’s dissatisfaction Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort caused by a post purchase conflict. Consumers may satisfy with the benefits of their choice, but also feel uneasy about losing the benefits of the brands not purchased Customer satisfaction is a key to building profitable relationships with consumers—to keeping and growing consumers and reaping their customer lifetime value Lecture Review ","date":"2025-03-11T11:34:12+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E8%90%A5%E9%94%80%E5%AD%A6-1/%E5%B0%81%E9%9D%A2_hu_38446184ce5f077b.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E8%90%A5%E9%94%80%E5%AD%A6-1/","title":"市场营销学 1"},{"content":"Introduction Understand how to represent business processes using the entity-relationship model Implement a database design using MySQL workbench Learn to query a database using SQL Understand new trends and technologies for database Why database?

Database System: a computerized record-keeping system, containing database and DBMS as well as some other components (e.g., hardware) Advantages of database approach Reduce but not eliminate redundancy all data items are integrated with a minimum amount of duplication Sharing of data the database is owned and accessed by the entire organization Data consistency management system reduces the risk of inconsistencies occurring Improved data accessibility due to data integration and query languages like SQL Specific steps Requirements Analysis Collect and analyze the business requirements Conceptual Design Design a conceptual model, e.g., ER model Logical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization Database Building (Physical Design) Build the database and write application programs Operation, Maintenance, \u0026amp; Tuning Use, maintain, and “tune” the database A good business rule Declarative – what, not how Precise – clear, agreed-upon meaning Atomic – one statement Consistent – internally and externally Expressible – structured, natural language Distinct – non-redundant Business-oriented – understood by business people Data definitions Explanation of a term or fact Term—word or phrase with specific meaning Fact—association between two or more terms Examples of facts: A course is a module of instruction in a particular subject area. A customer may request a model of car from a rental branch on a particular date. Guidelines for good data definition A concise description of essential data meaning Gathered in conjunction with systems requirements Accompanied by diagrams (e.g., E-R diagram) Achieved by consensus, and iteratively refined A good data object name is Related to business, not technical, characteristics Meaningful and self-documenting Unique Readable Composed of words from an approved list Written in standard syntax ER Modeling Part 1 Conceptual Design → Conceptual Model → Concept Business related DBSM-independent Definition of E-R Model A detailed, logical representation of the data for an organization or for a business area. The E-R model is expressed in terms of entities in the business environment, the relationships (or associations) among those entities, and the attributes (or properties) of both the entities and their relationships. An E-R model is normally expressed as an entity-relationship diagram (e-r diagram, or erD), which is a graphical Why E-R model?\nA crucial tool for understanding and communicating complex data structures to both technical and non-technical stakeholders It helps to build a well-organized and efficient database! Entities Requirements: Employees are assigned to projects. For employees we record their employee ID, first name, and last name. For each project we record a project ID and project description. One project must have at least one employee, one employee can be assigned to at most one project. Entities represent real-world objects; things which can be named: Entity type: collection of entities, e.g. employee, customer, sale (often corresponds to a table) Entity” is usually used for “Entity type” Entity instance: person, place, object, event, concept SHOULD BE:\nAn object that will have many instances in the database An object that will be composed of multiple attributes An object that we are trying to model SHOULD NOT BE:\nA user of the database system An output of the database system (e.g., a report) Relationship Description: Relationship type is a set of associations among entity types Each relationship is described by a name Example: Customer Product Customers Buys Product Product is_Purchased_by Customer \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo; is usually used for \u0026ldquo;relationship type\u0026rdquo; Symbol: Straight line labeled with the name Cardinality Cardinality Constraints 基数约束 the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity Minimum cardinality If zero, then optional If one or more, then mandatory 强制的 Maximum cardinality The maximum number: one or many Why Cardinality?\nData integrity and constraint enforcement Database and query efficiency Scalability Maximum cardinality One-to-One (1:1) Each entity instance in the relationship will have a maximum of one related entity instance e.g., each student has a student account One-to-Many (1:M) An entity instance on one side of the relationship can have many (more than one) related entity instances, but an entity instance on the other side will have a maximum of one (at most one) related entity instance e.g., each department has many instructors Many-to-Many (M:M) Entity instances on both sides of the relationship can have many related entity instances on the other side e.g., many students take many courses Attribute Description Property or characteristic of an entity type (often corresponds to a field in a table) they will be used for actual communication about the real - world phenomena represented by entities and relationships Symbol: Text inside the associated entity rectangle Classifications of attributes Required versus Optional Attributes Simple versus Composite Attributes An attribute broken into component parts Composite key attribute Single-Valued { } ersus Multivalued Attribute [ ] Stored versus Derived Attributes 存储属性与派生属性 Identifier Attributes Keys Identifier 标识符 An attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies individual instances of an entity type Will not change in value Will not be null No intelligent identifiers (e.g., containing locations or people that might change) Substitute new, simple keys for long, composite keys Candidate key 候选键 All available unique, required identifiers to an entity Primary key 主键 The best one among the candidate key ER Modeling Part 2 Modeling relationship Relationship Types vs. Relationship Instances The relationship type is modeled as lines between entity types The relationship instance is between specific entity instances Two entities can have more than one type of relationship between them (multiple relationships) Degree of relationships: the number of entity types that participate in it Relationships can have attributes Associative Entity – combination of relationship and entity Degree of relationships Degree of a relationship is the number of entity types that participate in it Unary relationship Binary relationship Ternary relationship Attributes on relationships Attributes\nCan be associated with entities Can also be assigned to relationships A binary relationship with an attribute\nHere, the date completed attribute pertains specifically to the employee’s completion of a course It is an attribute of the relationship An associative entity\nAssociative entity is like a relationship with an attribute, but it is also considered to be an entity in its own right Note that the many-to-many cardinality between entities has been replaced by two one-to-many relationships with the associative entity Associative entities\nWhen should we use an Associative Entity? All relationships for the associative entity should be many. The associative entity could have meanings independent of the other entities. The associative entity preferably has a unique identifier, and should also have other attributes. The associative entity may participate in other relationships other than the entities of the associated relationship. Supertypes and subtypes Why Super and Subtypes?\nAvoids redundant data\nSupports specialization and generalization\nImproves query efficiency\nA query for all employees can be performed on the employee table, without needing to check each subtype separately Allows for flexible business rules\nE.g., Assistant \u0026amp; Skill Define a subtype (specialization) when:\nThe subtype has additional attributes of interest (e.g., billing rate is recorded for consultants only) and/or The subtype participants in additional relationships Enhanced ER model\nExtends original ER model with new modeling constructs Subtype\nA subgrouping of the entities in an entity type that has attributes distinct from those in other subgrouping Supertype\nA generic entity type that has a relationship with one or more subtypes Attribute inheritance\nSubtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype Attribute inheritance An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype e.g., if ‘Michael’ is in subtype Manager, the data object is also in supertype Employee Subtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype possesses subtype-specific attributes Relationships and subtypes Relationships at the supertype level indicate that ALL subtypes will participate in the relationship The instances of a subtype may participate in a relationship UNIQUE to that subtype. In this situation, the relationship is shown at the subtype level Specialization process Specialization: the process of maximizing the differences between members of an entity by identifying their distinguishing characteristics Specialization is a top-down approach to: Defining a set of supertypes Defining a subtype when It has additional attributes of interest It participates in additional relationships Generalization process Generalization is the reverse of the specialization process 泛化是特化过程的反向操作 Generalization: the process of minimizing the differences between entities by identifying their common characteristics (common attributes and relationships) Generalization is a bottom-up approach to identifying several entities identifying a generalized supertype from these entities Strong vs. Weak entities Strong entities exist independently of other types of entities has its own unique identifier represented with single-line rectangle Weak entities dependent on a strong entity\u0026hellip;cannot exist on its own does not have a unique identifier represented with double-line rectangle Identifying relationship links strong entities to weak entities represented with double line Assignment 1 Exercise 1 3C is a consulting company in Newark. It needs a database to keep track of the assignment of employees to projects. For each employee, 3C wants to record an employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday. For each project, 3C wants to record a project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date. Employees are included in the database even when they have not been assigned to any project. A project must have at least one employee assigned. An employee’s billing rate (the price they charge client for their services) may vary by projects, and 3C wishes to record the applicable billing rate for each employee when assigned to different projects (Hint: Add relationship attributes).\n对于每位employee，3C希望记录 employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday 对于每个Project，3C希望记录project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date 即使员工尚未被分配到任何项目，也会将其纳入数据库 一个项目必须至少分配一名员工 员工的计费费率 employee\u0026rsquo;s billing rate（他们为其服务向客户收取的价格）可能因项目而异 3C 希望记录每个员工在被分配到不同项目时的适用计费费率 Exercise 2 A restaurant is looking to enhance its inventory tracking and optimize sales. One crucial aspect of this system is the relationship between orders and products. Each order has OrderID and Date. Each Product has Product ID and Product Name. The information about a product can be recorded before it is included in any order. The same product can be part of multiple orders. Additionally, some products are composed of multiple other products (e.g., Big Mac Value Meal).\nProduct Big Mac (ProductID: 1003) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 4806 Sesame Seed Bun 1 each 5890 10:1 Patty 2 each 6515 Cheese 2 slice 9875 Dehydrated Onions 1 oz 4050 Lettuce 2 oz 7432 Special Sauce 2 Tbsp 5315 Salt 0.5 Tsp Small Fries (ProductID: 143) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 5315 Salt 0.25 Tsp 7499 Potato 10 oz Small Diet Coke (ProductID: 2499) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1978 Diet Coke Syrup 0.5 Tsp 1277 Water 12 oz Happy Meal (ProductID: 9444) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 522 Cheeseburger 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 small 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each Big Mac Value Meal (ProductID: 2911) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1003 Big Mac 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 each 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each 每个 Order 都有 OrderID \u0026amp; Date 每个 Product 都有 Product ID \u0026amp; Product Name 产品信息可在其被纳入任何订单之前记录 部分产品由多个其他产品组成 Exercise 3 The 3C company would like to record the information about its employees (either fulltime or part-time) in an enterprise information system. For all employees, they record SSN (unique for each employee), name, address, date-of-birth and degree. They record the salary and date hired for fulltime employees only. Further, the bonus of all managers (who are fulltime employees) has to be recorded. Bonus is not recorded for other fulltime employees (e.g., engineers); for managers only. 3C also records hourly wage for part-time employees. 3C would like to record additional information for interns and custodians (both part-time employees). For interns, the number of hours per week and the manager they work for need to be recorded. An intern is assigned to at least one manager. If an intern works for more than one manager, 3C needs to record how many hours (a week) the intern works for each manager. Not all managers have interns. A few managers have more than one intern. For custodians the shift time need to be recorded.\n所有员工：记录社会安全号码（SSN，每位员工唯一）、姓名、地址、出生日期和学位 全职员工：除上述信息外，还记录工资和雇佣日期。其中，经理（属于全职员工）需额外记录奖金，其他全职员工（如工程师）不记录奖金 兼职员工：记录小时工资。对于实习生和管理员这两类兼职员工，还需记录额外信息 实习生：记录每周工作小时数，以及为之工作的经理。实习生至少被分配给一位经理，若为多位经理工作，需记录为每位经理工作的每周时长。并非所有经理都有实习生，部分经理有多名实习生 管理员：记录轮班时间 Exercise 4 An international school of technology has hired you to create a database management system to assist in scheduling classes. After several interviews with the president, you have come up with the following list of entities, attributes, and initial business rules:\nRoom is identified by BID and Room No and also has a Capacity. A room can be either a lab or a classroom. If it is a classroom, it has an additional attribute called Board Type. Media is identified by MID and has attributes of Media Type and Type Description. Note: Here we are tracking type of media (such as a VCR, projector, etc.), not the individual piece of equipment. Tracking of equipment is outside of the scope of this project. Computer is identified by CID and has attributes Computer Type, Type Description, Disk Capacity, and Processor Speed. Please note: As with Media Type, we are tracking only the type of computer, not an individual computer. You can think of this as a class of computers (e.g., Core™ i7 2.6GHz) Instructor has identifier EID and has attributes Name, Rank, and Office Phone. Course has identifier CourseID (e.g., MIS804) and has attributes Course Description and Credits. Courses can have one, none, or many prerequisites. Courses also have one or more sections. Section has attributes SecID (e.g., 010), Semester, Year, and Enrollment Limit. After some further discussions, you have come up with some additional business rules to help you create the initial design:\nAn instructor teaches one, none, or many sections of a course in a given semester. A room can be scheduled for many sections or no section in a given semester of a given year. However, one section can only be scheduled in one room. A room can have one type of media, several types of media, or no media. Instructors are trained to use one, none, or many types of media. A lab has one or more computer types. However, a classroom does not have any computers. A room cannot be both a classroom and a lab. There also are no other room types to be incorporated into the system. Room: BID \u0026amp; Room No, Capacity lab classroom: Board Type Media: MID, Media Type, Type Description Computer: CID, Computer Type, Type Description, Disk Capacity, Processor Speed Instructor: EID, Name, Rank, and Office Phone Course: CourseID, Course Description, Credits Section: SecID, Semester, Year, and Enrollment Limit Translating ER Model into Relational Model Logical Design How to connect multiple entities?\nHow to ensure data integrity?\nLogical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization What is logical design?\nLogical database design is about creating stable database structures— correctly expressing the requirements in a technical language. Conceptual data modeling is about understanding the organization—getting the requirements right They show how data is connected and how changes to one area of the system can impact other areas helps ensure data integrity, as it provides a way to ensure data is consistent and accurate across the system We focus on the relational data model based on mathematical theory and therefore has a solid theoretical foundation Relation Definition: A relation is a named, two-dimensional table of data Table consists of rows (records), and columns (attribute or field) Relations (tables) correspond with entity types实体类型 and with relationships types关系类型 Rows correspond with entity instances and with relationship instances Columns correspond with attributes Note: The word relation (in relational database) is NOT the same as the word relationship (in E-R model) Relational Model Step 1: Strong entity and attributes\nStep 2: Binary relationships\nStep 2.1: One-to-many relationships FK on the M-side Primary key on the one side becomes a foreign key on the many side No null value in the foreign key \u0026mdash; this is because of the mandatory minimum cardinality Step 2.2: One-to-one relationships FK on the optional side Step 2.3: Many-to-Many relationships Add a new relation (with PFKs) Step 3: Weak entity\nA separate relation with a foreign key taken from the strong entity A new relation with FK from the strong entity as part of its PK (PFK) Step 4: Unary/recursive relationships 一元/递归关系\nOne-to-many -\u0026gt; one relation with FK\nMany-to-many -\u0026gt; add a new relation (with PFKs)\nStep 5: Multi-valued attributes 多值属性\nMultivalued attribute becomes a separate relation with foreign key A new relation with PFK Step 6: Supertypes and subtypes\nOne relation for supertype and for each subtype Supertype attributes go into supertype relation Subtype attributes go into each subtype; primary key of supertype relation also becomes primary key of subtype relation 1:1 relationship established between supertype and each subtype, with supertype as primary table PFK in each subtype Integrity Constraints Entity Integrity No primary key attribute may be null. All primary key fields MUST have data Referential Integrity Any foreign key value MUST match a primary key value (or the foreign key can be null) e.g. Delete Rules Restrict – don’t allow delete of “customer” side if related rows exist in “order” side Cascade – automatically delete “order” side rows that correspond with the “customer” side row to be deleted Set-to-Null – set the foreign key in the dependent side to null if deleting from the “customer” side → not allowed for weak entities Many-to-many(M:N) Highlights Always adding another relation (table/associative entity) to convert a M:N relationship to two 1:M relationships MySQL workbench will automatically generate a new table if you choose M:N relationship between two tables! Be careful about the changes in Cardinalities M:N -\u0026gt; 1:M The minimum cardinalities need to be adjusted accordingly – Swap Identifying vs Non-identifying relationship Identifying relationship - where the child entity\u0026rsquo;s identity/existence relies solely on the parent entity. No parent entity means no child entity For an identifying relationship, you put the primary key column from the parent into the primary key column of the child (along with other columns needed to provide uniqueness) For a non-identifying relationship, you put the primary key column of the parent into the table of the child, but not in the primary key Tutorial File → new model 外观设置 Model → Model Options → Diagram → 不勾选 Show Column Types → 勾选 Show Captions Model → Object Notation → 勾选 ID1F1X Model → Relationship Notation → 勾选 Crow\u0026rsquo;s Foot (IE) Normalization Logical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization Normalization in database design Normalization Process for evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize data redundancies and ensure data integrity Works through a series of stages called normal forms Normal form Second normal form Third normal form 2 NF is better than 1 NF; 3 NF is better than 2 NF For most business database design purpose, 3 NF is the highest we need to go in the normalization process Highest level of normalization is not always most desirable Different normal forms Conversion to first normal form First Normal Form (1NF) Each row has a PK value Every column should have single values No repeating groups (columns) Anomalies 异常 Anomalies are issues caused by redundant data Insertion annomalies Modification anomalies Deletion anomalies Functional dependency (FD) 函数依赖\nThe value of one attribute (the determinant: e.g., A ) determines the value of another attribute (e.g., B) (denoted A -\u0026gt; B)\nWe should identify functional dependencies that hold for all possible values relation NF Problem – Partial dependencies\n1 NF tables are still subject to data redundancies -\u0026gt; anomalies Partial dependencies: Only part of the PK can determine some non-primary key attributes some non-primary key attributes are functionally dependent on only part of the PK Transformation between normal forms Convert 1NF to 2NF Second Normal Form (2NF): every non-PK attribute is fully functionally dependent on the PK\nA relation with a single attribute PK is automatically in 2 NF Step1: Identify all dependencies\nFDs (from business rules): courseNo, sectionNo → title, units, deptCode, instructorID, fName, lName courseNo → title, units, deptCode instructorID → fName, lName FD diagram Depicts all dependencies found within a given table structure Helpful in getting bird’s-eye view of all relationships among a table’s attributes Step2: Remove partial dependency\nWrite the determinant of the partial dependency the key of a new relation Place the dependent attributes on a separate line as in the partial dependency in the new relation along with their determinant Keep the rest of the original relation Convert 2NF to 3NF A table is in third normal form (3NF) if: It is in 2NF and no non-PK attribute is transitively dependent on the PK Step 1: Identify transitive dependencies For every transitive dependency, write its determinant Step 2: Remove transitive dependencies as a PK for a new table Place the dependent attributes in the transitive dependency in the new table identified in step1 Keep the rest of the other tables Normalization and database design Normalization should be part of the design process\nMake sure that proposed entities meet required normal form before table structures are created\nMany real-world databases have been improperly designed or burdened with anomalies if improperly modified during course of time\nYou may be asked to redesign and modify existing databases\nE-R diagram\nProvides the big picture, or macro view, of an organization’s data requirements and operations Created through an iterative process\nIdentifying relevant entities, their attributes and their relationship Use results to identify additional entities and attributes Normalization procedures\nFocus on the characteristics of specific entities A micro view of the entities within the ER diagram Difficult to separate normalization process from ER modeling process\nTwo techniques should be used concurrently\nSummary Normalization is a table design technique aimed at minimizing data redundancies First three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) are most commonly encountered Normalization is an important part—but only a part—of the design process Continue the iterative ER process until all entities and their attributes are defined and all equivalent tables are in 3NF Assignment 2 Exercise 1 Logical Data Model Exercise 2 Logical Data Model Exercise 3 Logical Data Model Exercise 4 Logical Data Model ","date":"2025-03-10T15:56:56+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/title_hu_e240d0350799f182.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/","title":"实体关系建模"},{"content":"Networking Fundamentals Network \u0026amp;

LOGIN\nThe username and password are encoded in Base64 and transmitted one by one, first the username and then the password. CRAM - MD5\nThe server requests the client to solve a computational challenge using the password. The client\u0026rsquo;s response is a string containing a username and a 16 - byte digest in hexadecimal notation. This string is BASE64 - encoded. Mail message format SMTP [RFC 821]: protocol for exchanging email message\nRFC 822: standard for text message\nheader lines\nTo: From: Subject: different from SMTP commands\nbody\nthe \u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;, ASCII characters only MIME: multimedia mail extension, RFC 2045, 2056\nadditional lines in message header declare MIME content type Scenario: Alice sends message to Bob Alice uses her User Agent (UA) to compose a message and sets the \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; field as \u0026ldquo;bob@someschool.edu \u0026rdquo;. Alice\u0026rsquo;s UA sends the message to her mail server, and the message is placed in the message queue. The client - side of SMTP opens a TCP connection with Bob\u0026rsquo;s mail server. User Agent - Mail Server The SMTP client sends Alice\u0026rsquo;s message over the TCP connection. Bob\u0026rsquo;s mail server places the message in Bob\u0026rsquo;s mailbox. Bob invokes his User Agent to read the message. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) deliver and store emails to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s server. Email Access Protocols: retrieval from server POP (Post Office Protocol, based on RFC 1939 standard) authorization process between the user agent and the server to achieve the function of downloading emails. IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol, based on RFC 1730 standard) more features (more complex). manipulation of stored msgs on server HTTP Hotmail, Yahoo!Mail POP3 \u0026ldquo;download and delete\u0026rdquo; mode You cannot re-read e mail if you changes client \u0026ldquo;download-and keep\u0026rdquo; mode copies of messages on different clients POP3 is stateless across sessions IMAP Keep all messages in one place: the server. Allow users to organize messages in folders. IMAP maintains the user state across sessions: names of folders and the mappings between message IDs and folders. Application Layer Protocols - HTTP Web and HTTP First, some jargon:\nA web page consists of objects. An object can be an HTML file, a JPEG image, a Java applet, an audio file, etc. A web page consists of a base HTML file which includes several referenced objects. Each object is addressable by a URL. Example URL: HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol\nWeb’s application layer protocol\nclient/server model\nclient: browser that requests, receives, \u0026ldquo;displays\u0026rdquo; Web objects server: Web server sends objects in response to requests HTTP 1.0: RFC 1945\nHTTP 1.1: RFC 2068\nHTTP request message two types of HTTP messages: request, response HTTP request message: ASCII (human-readable format) general format Method types HTTP/1.1 GET POST HEAD PUT uploads file in entity body to path specified in URL field DELETE asks server to leave requested object out of response deletes file specified in the URL field HTTP/1.0 GET, POST, HEAD Uploading from input Post method: Web page often includes form input Input is uploaded to server in entity body URL method: Uses GET method Input is uploaded in URL field of request line HTTP response message In first line in server-\u0026gt;client response message. A few sample codes: 200 OK request succeeded, requested object later in this message 301 Moved Permanently requested object moved, new location specified later in this message (Location:) 400 Bad Request request message not understood by server 404 Not Found requested document not found on this server 505 HTTP Version Not Supported HTTP/2 HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015. HTTP/2 allows the server to \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; content, that is, to respond with data for more queries than the client requested. Multiplexing of requests, header compression, and prioritization of request.
