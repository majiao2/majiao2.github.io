While their physical appearance may resemble that of other retail stores, pharmacies operate under specific laws that differentiate them. Many medications, particularly prescription drugs, cannot be sold without a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Even with a prescription, there are often limits on the quantity of drugs a customer can purchase. These regulations are designed to ensure the safe and responsible distribution of medications.\nIn addition to prescription verification, pharmacists in China are required to perform thorough background checks on customers, including reviewing their medical history. This helps ensure that patients are not involved in drug abuse and prevents harmful drug interactions. As a result, pharmacy management systems play a crucial role in ensuring compliance with these regulations. These systems facilitate the tracking of prescriptions, managing medication limits, and maintaining accurate customer records, all of which contribute to patient safety and efficient pharmacy operations.\nWith this project, our aim is to develop a comprehensive system that could deal with challenges faced in day to day operation of a modern pharmacy.\nEntities Coutomer When a customer arrives in the pharmacy, we identify them based on their PIN (Personal Identification Number). If they are a new customer, they are asked for their name, date of birth, phone number, gender and address.\nInsurance In China, as of 2023, the basic medical insurance coverage rate remains stable at over 95% (National Healthcare Security Administration data). The wide - spread coverage is mainly due to the continuous improvement and popularization of the national basic medical insurance system, which includes the urban employee basic medical insurance, the urban and rural residents\u0026rsquo; basic medical insurance. The high coverage is crucial because medical expenses can be relatively large for some serious diseases and treatments. Without insurance, many people may face financial difficulties in affording necessary medical services.\nIf a customer has health insurance, we store the insurance ID (unique for each customer), start date, end date and Co-Insurance. Co-Insurance is a percentage amount that insurance company pays for a medicinal purchase. Given the customer PIN and insurance ID, the system should be able to automatically calculate the amount paid by medical insurance fund and customer.\nEmployees An employee has same details as a customer but they are also given a company ID, that is unique for them. An employee has to have one of the following roles:\nPharmacist CPhT (Certified Pharmacy Technician) Intern (can work in the pharmacy part time) Cashier Apart from pharmacy cashiers, all personnel directly involved in drug dispensing and preparation are required to obtain professional qualification certificates issued by the National Medical Products Administration.\nPrescription Most of the drugs in the pharmacy can only be sold with a prescription. A prescription contains customer’s PIN, the prescribing Doctor’s ID (required by law) and when the prescription was prescribed. Each prescription contains a number of prescribed drugs with drug name, quantity and refill limit of each of them.\nPrescription Drug Prescription drugs can only be dispensed with a valid doctor\u0026rsquo;s prescription. They\u0026rsquo;re more potent and regulated strictly. Prescription Drug is represented in the system with a unique identifier, PresplD. This helps in precisely tracking each individual prescription - related drug record. The DrugName clearly states the name of the medication, which can be either the generic or brand name. PrespQty indicates the quantity of the drug that has been prescribed for the customer. This is an important detail as it affects how much of the drug is dispensed. RefillLimit defines the number of times the customer can get a refill for this particular drug based on the original prescription.\nOrder An order is created from the prescription. This data has to be stored separately because customer may:\nBuy less medicine than prescription specifies Come back for refills based on same prescription Each order has a unique Order ID that is automatically assigned by the system. Each order can have multiple drugs, each with their ordered quantity and price. We also record batch number of the drug.\nOrdered Drugs Ordered drugs are selected by customers per prescription or OTC needs. The system records drug name, quantity (which may differ from prescription), price, and links them to a unique Order ID. For prescription - based orders, it cross - references prescription details for compliance.\nBill Once an order has been completed, a bill is generated by the system. This bill is handed over to the customer and contains order information, insurance information as well as breakdown of amount paid. The breakdown should be automatically calculated by the system based on insurance, customer and medicine data.\nMedicine (Inventory) Drugs are divided into \u0026ldquo;over-the-counter drugs\u0026rdquo; (OTC drugs), \u0026ldquo;prescription drugs\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;controlled drugs\u0026rdquo;. For all types of drugs, especially prescription drugs and controlled drugs, pharmaceutical institutions and medical facilities are legally obligated to maintain accurate and up-to-date inventory records. This is not only for the purpose of record - keeping but also to effectively manage stock levels. Timely inventory management helps to ensure the continuous availability of necessary drugs while also preventing overstocking or shortages. OTC drugs, on the other hand, are more accessible to the public but still need to be sold and inventoried in accordance with relevant regulations to guarantee their quality and proper supply.\nDisposal Drugs are marked for disposal when expired, damaged, or in case of controlled drugs following medical regulations. Once disposed, inventory records are updated. The system then generates a disposal record, which includes the drug name, the batch number of the drug, the name of the company that produced the drug, and the dispensed quantity.\nNotifications The system should be able to generate notifications based on the following four events:\nStock for a medicine is low (less than 100 tablets) Some medicine will expire in next 60 days Drugs are marked for disposal Drugs are successfully disposed The notifications are sent to all the employees who are Pharmacists.\nER Modeling ER Diagram Logical Data Model Diagram ","date":"2025-03-20T21:25:06+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E8%8D%AF%E6%88%BF%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/pharmacy_hu_9232b17c80a5c985.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E8%8D%AF%E6%88%BF%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/","title":"药房数据库管理系统"},{"content":"Physical Database Design Intro to physical database design Database Building (Physical Design)\nBuild the database and write application programs Purpose\ntranslate the logical description of data into the technical specifications for storing and retrieving data using a specific DBMS Goal\ncreate a design for storing data that will provide adequate performance and ensure database integrity, security, and recoverability MySQL database structure A MySQL database consists of multiple user accounts A user account can contain different databases Also called database schemas Physical design process Field, data type, and index Dsigning fields What is field?\nsmallest unit of application data recognized by system software Field design considerations\nChoosing data type Coding, compression, encryption Controlling data integrity Naming rules for tables and fields 1 to 64 characters long\nCan contain letters, numbers, or underscores\nCan’t contain certain symbols and keywords\nEvery table in your database must have a unique name\nEvery field in a table must have a unique name\nCase sensitivity (in MySQL):\nKeywords: No Table and Columns/Fields name: No (exception: Linux) Purpose\nSpecify internal encoding Optimize internal storage use Provide error checking mechanisms Datatypes in different database may be slightly different\nMain data types in MySQL Text data types\nCHAR VARCHAR Number data types\nIntegers: INT and variations Floating point numbers: DECIMAL, FLOAT Dates \u0026amp; times\nDATE, TIME, and variations Character: Use an appropriate character data type for all fields that are not numbers or dates\nNames, addresses, etc. Postal codes, telephone numbers, social security numbers Numeric\nSurrogate keys 代理键 (primary key ID values) All numeric data you might use in a calculation (prices, quantities, etc.) CHAR data type\nFor fixed-width character fields (1 – 255 characters) Fields in which you know the exact number of characters Pads out the remaining characters with blank spaces Removes the trailing blank spaces when data is retrieved VARCHAR data type\nFor variable-width character fields (1-255 characters) Number of characters varies for individual data values Values are not padded with blank spaces CHAR or VARCHAR?\nUse CHAR when the sizes of the column data entries are consistent Use VARCHAR when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably Use VARCHAR(MAX) when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably, and the string length might exceed 8,000 bytes Q\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; But if VARCHAR is so efficient in handling the space management dynamically based on the content being stored, why databases has the support for CHAR datatype, all CHAR(n) fields can be VARCHAR(n) fields, right ? \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A CHAR fields require less string manipulation because of fixed field widths, index lookups against CHAR field are on average 20% faster than that of VARCHAR fields.

For example, we want to find out the offering that a professor teaches? Data sources are fragmented To get a comprehensive view of a scenario Uncover interesting patterns Combine information from two tables Form pairs of related rows from two tables where the matching columns (recall: FK) in each of the two tables have the same value To perform a join Simply list more than one table name in the FROM clause, using a comma as a separator, and FROM offering, faculty Typically use a WHERE clause to specify the join conditions WHERE offering.FacSSN = faculty.FacSSN Alias An alias can be used for a table named in the FROM clause, where the alias is separated from the table name with a space e.g., FROM offering O, faculty F Can two different tables have the same alisa? When can an alias be used? Used to qualify a column name whenever there is ambiguity regarding the source of the column name e.g., WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN Also used as a shorthand notation for the table name An alias can be used anywhere in place of the table name Example Example: Two-table joining\nQ1: list the OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName for fall 2002 IS courses taught by assistant professors, and order results by FacLastName (ASC) and CourseNo (DESC)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM offering O, faculty F WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN AND FacRank = \u0026#39;ASST\u0026#39; AND CourseNo LIKE \u0026#39;IS%\u0026#39; AND OffTerm = \u0026#39;FALL\u0026#39; AND OffYear = 2002 ORDER BY FacLastName, CourseNo DESC; Example: Three-table joining\nQ2: List Leonard Vince’s teaching schedule in fall 2002. For each course, list the offering number, course number, number of units, days, location, and time.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 SELECT OfferNo, O.CourseNo, CrsUnits, OffDays, OffLocation, OffTime FROM faculty F, course C, offering O WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN AND O.CourseNo = C.CourseNo AND OffYear = 2002 AND OffTerm = \u0026#39;FALL\u0026#39; AND FacFirstName = \u0026#39;Leonard\u0026#39; AND FacLastName = \u0026#39;Vince\u0026#39; Summarization in multiple tables\nPowerful combination List join conditions in the WHERE clause Q3: List the number of students enrolled for each 2003 offering.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT offering.OfferNo, COUNT(*) AS NumStudents FROM enrollment E, offering O WHERE E.OfferNo = O.OfferNo AND OfferYear = 2003 GROUP BY O.OfferNo Different types of JOIN Inner Join and Outer Join List all the offerings and the information about their instructors 1 2 3 SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM offering O, faculty F WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN We have 13 offerings in Offering tables but only see 11 offerings in the result. Why? New demand for Join We need another operator for the item that have a match, it behaves like a Join but for the items that have NO MATCH, it appends the record with NULLs The operators with these properties are called outer joins. (There are several of them) The operators that we studied already are also called inner joins (To distinguish them from outer joins) (Inner/Natural) Join excludes non matching rows Preserving non matching rows is important in some problems Outer join variations Full outer join 全外连接 One-sided outer join 单边外连接 JOIN and INNER JOIN Use INNER/FULL/LEFT/RIGHT JOIN and ON keywords in the FROM clause INNER JOIN = JOIN Mixing Inner and Outer Join Combine columns from the Faculty, Offering, and Course tables for IS Courses (list OfferNo, CourseNo, OffTerm, CrsDesc, FacSSN, FacLastName). Including a row in the result even if there is not an assigned instructor.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT OfferNo, offering.CourseNo, OffTerm, CrsDesc, faculty.FacSSN, FacLastName FROM ( faculty RIGHT JOIN offering ON offering.FacSSN = faculty.FacSSN) INNER JOIN course ON course.courseNo = offering.courseNo WHERE course.CourseNo LIKE \u0026#39;IS%\u0026#39; Structured Query Language Part 3 How to write nested queries Type 1 nested queries Retrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students.\nQuery inside q query Use in WHERE and HAVING conditions Executes one time No reference to outer query Also known as non-correlated or independent nested query 1 2 3 4 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE FacSSN NOT IN (SELECT StdSSN FROM student ); Type 2 nested queries Similar to nested loops Executes one time for each row of outer query Reference to outer query Also known as correlated or variably nested query Retrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM student WHERE student.StdSSN = faculty.FacSSN ); Type 2 nested query animation Alternative Outer Join with Only Nonmatching Rows\nRetrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students. 1 2 3 4 5 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty LEFT JOIN student ON faculty.FacSSN = student.StdSSN WHERE student.StdSSN IS NULL; Can we use Inner Join?\n1 2 3 SELECT DISTINCT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty, student WHERE student.StdSSN \u0026lt;\u0026gt; faculty.FacSSN; Difference problems cannot be solved with inequality joins there is at least one student row that does not match every faculty row.\nOther use cases List the first name of faculty who has the highest salary.\n1 2 SELECT FacFirstName, MAX(FacSalary) FROM faculty 1 2 3 SELECT FacFirstName, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE FacSalary = (SELECT MAX(FacSalary) FROM faculty) We want to know the total amount of faculty’s highest salary for each department.\n1 2 3 4 SELECT SUM(MaxSalary) FROM(SELECT FacDept, Max(FacSalary) AS MaxSalary FROM faculty GROUP BY FacDept) AS tmp1 Write and Edit Data Data manipulation language Query(read-only) SELECT: to query data in the database Update(write) INSERT: inserts new rows of data into a table UPDATE: modifies existing data in a table DELETE: deletes rows of data from a table Attention: SQL uses the reserved keyword UPDATE to mean \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo; specifically. However, the term \u0026ldquo;update\u0026rdquo; is also used to refer to the three operations Insert a Single Row Format of INSERT statement INSERT INTO TableName[(columnList)] VALUES (dataValueList) columnList A list of one or more column names separated by commas Optional If omitted, SQL assumes all columns in order If specified, any columns that are omitted from the list are assumed to have NULL values dataValueList must match columnList Have same number of items Have direct correspondence in the position of items in the two lists Data type must be compatible INSERT Example Insert a row into the Student table supplying values for all columns.\n1 2 3 4 5 INSERT INTO student (StdSSN, StdFirstName, StdLastName, StdCity, StdState, StdZip, StdClass, StdMajor, StdGPA) VALUES (\u0026#39;999999999\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;JOE\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;STUDENT\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;SEATAC\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;WA\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;98042-1121\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;FR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;IS\u0026#39;, 0.0) Web crawler + INSERT Scrapy - How to crawl website \u0026amp; store data in Microsoft SQL Server database?\n1 2 3 self.cursor.execute(\u0026#34;INSERT INTO MYTABLE(text, author, tags) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\u0026#34;, (item[\u0026#39;text\u0026#39;], item[\u0026#39;author\u0026#39;], item[\u0026#39;tags\u0026#39;])) UPDATE Statement Formate of UPDATE statement 1 2 3 UPDATE TableName SET columnName1 = dataValue1 [, columnName2 = dataValue2 …] [WHERE searchCondition]; Processing order: UPDATE→WHERE→SET SET clause: specifies the names of one or more columns that are to be updated WHEREclause is optional If omitted, all rows are updated for the named columns If specified, only those rows that satisfy the searchCondition are updated dataValue(s): must have compatible data type(s) for the corresponding column(s) UPDATE Example Change the major and class of Homer Wells.\n1 2 3 UPDATE student SET StdMajor = \u0026#39;ACCT\u0026#39;, StdClass = \u0026#39;SO\u0026#39; WHERE StdFirstName = \u0026#39;HOMER\u0026#39; AND StdLastName = \u0026#39;WELLS\u0026#39; DELETE Statement Format of DELETE statement 1 2 DELETE FROM TableName [WHERE searchCondition]; WHERE clause is optional If omitted, all rows are deleted from the table; however, this doesn’t delete the table itself (i.e., table’s column names are still there).

Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational goals. The Marketinig Process Understanding the Marketplace and Customer Needs Customer Needs, Wants, and Demands Needs are states of deprivation Physical - food, clothing, warmth, safety Social - belonging and affection Individual - Knowledge and self-expression Wants are the form that needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality Demands are wants backed by buying power You need to be able to communicate with your friends \u0026amp; family. You need a mobile phone You may want to change a phone whenever a new model is released Your \u0026ldquo;want” backed by your power to buy a new phone become market demand Can marketers create demand?\nGood companies satisfy market demands, great companies create market demands! Market offering Market offerings are some combination of products, services, information, or experience offered to a market to satisfy a need or want.\nGoods Physical goods constitute the bulk of production and marketing efforts Services A growing portion of business activities are focused on the production of services The U.S. economy today consists of a 70–30 services to goods mix Persons Celebrity marketing is a major business Properties Intangible rights of ownership of either real property (real estate) or financial property (stock and bonds) Experiences By orchestrating several services and goods, a firm can create market experiences orchestrate v. 精心安排 Organizations Actively work to build a strong, favorable, and unique image in the minds of the target publics.

Question: Monks\u0026rsquo; demand for wooden combs Definition of Marketing Research We define marketing research as the systematic design, collection, analysis, and reporting of data and findings relevant to a specific marketing situation facing the company Qualitative Vs. Quantitative Research How to evaluate the service quality of a hotel? Different Objectives Qualitative\nTo uncover prevalent trends in thoughts and opinions To gain an understanding of underlying reasons and motivations To generate ideas and/or hypotheses for later quantitative research Quantitative\nTo quantify views and generalize results from a sample to the population of interest Sometimes followed by qualitative research which is used to explore some findings further Which one is better for marketing research? Quantitative Qualitative Strengths Provide data that is descriptive. Provides details about human behavior, emotion, and personality characteristics that quantitative studies cannot match. Control the influence of irrelevant variables, so as to discover the cause-and-effect relation of variables accurately. Weakness Provide no detail information for data interpretation. Less statistical power than quantitative study. Ignores the elements that can not be quantified. Differences in Method and Outcome Quantitative Qualitative Sample Usually a larger number of cases representing the population of interest. Usually a small number of non-representative cases. Random. Non-random. Data collection Survey, panel data, experiment, etc. Interview, observation, group discussion, etc. Data analysis Statistical. Non-statistical Findings Findings are usually conclusive and have good generalizability. Findings are not conclusive and cannot be used to make generalizations about the population of interest. The Marketing Research Process Define the problem and research objectives Example of a Research Brief\nAmericanAirlines (AA) is looking for new ways to serve its passengers It is reviewing many new ideas, especially to cater to its first-class passengers on very long flights, one idea was to provide an Internet connection on the flight Research objective: Whether to provide network access service during flight? How first-class passengers would respond to this service? The cost of this service? How much extra they would be willing to pay if a charge was made? Choice of first-class passenger\nWhat types of first-class passengers would respond to using an in flight Internet service?\nPrice level\nHow many first-class passengers will use the Internet service at different price levels?\nPreference of airline\nHow many extra first-class passengers might choose the Airlines because of the new service?\nPreference of WIFI service\nHow important is Internet service to first-class passengers relative to other services, such as a power plug or enhanced entertainment?\nDevelop the research plan Most commonly used research approaches in marketing\nObservation Fresh data can be gathered by observing the relevant actors and settings Consumers can be unobtrusively observed as they shop or as they consume products The Role of an observer Complete participant (going native) Part participant and part observer Complete observer Focus group Gathering 6 to 10 people carefully selected based on certain demographic, psychographic, or other considerations and brought together to discuss various topics of interest at length A professional research moderator provides questions based on the marketing managers\u0026rsquo; discussion guide or agenda In-depth Interview Open-ended, discovery-oriented method, which allows the interviewer to deeply explore the speaker\u0026rsquo;s feelings and perspectives on a subject This results in rich background information that can shape further questions relevant to the topic Types of interview Personal one-on-one interview Telephone interview Email Key Characteristics of Good In-depth Interview Open-ended Questions Questions need to be worded so that respondents talk about the topic, not just answer “yes” or “no” Seek Understanding and Interpretation It is important to use active listening skills to carefully interpret what the speaker is saying Open-minded Judgment or criticism can act as barriers to communication Flexible and Responsive Good interviewers can think on their feet, respond to challenges, and adjust their questions Patient Allow the respondent to speak freely and open up at a pace that is personally comfortable Survey Difference with interview? Companies undertake surveys to learn about people\u0026rsquo;s knowledge, beliefs, preferences, and satisfaction, and to measure these magnitudes using structured questions in the general population Usually involve a large sample size Research Approaches: Sampling issue A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population that represents a portion of the whole population There are three decisions that need to be made when designing a sample Sampling units - who or what is being surveyed Sample size - how many individuals should be surveyed Sampling procedure - how the sample should be selected Behavioral Research Customers leave traces of their purchasing behavior in store scanning data, catalog purchases, and online customer databases Advantages of behavioral data Actual purchases reflect consumers\u0026rsquo; preferences and often are more reliable than statements they offer to market researchers E.g., Customers may report preferences for popular brands, and yet the data show them actually buying other brands Technology has now advanced to such a degree that marketers can use devices such as eye-tracking, skin sensors, brain wave scanners, and full body scanners to get consumer responses Collect the information The data collection phase of marketing research is generally the most expensive and the most prone to error Professional data collection service is available Analyze the information The next-to-last step in the process is to extract findings from the collected data Various data analysis methods are available The researcher will also apply some advanced statistical techniques and decision models in the hope of discovering additional findings Present the findings The researcher presents findings relevant to the major marketing decisions facing management Make the decision The managers who commissioned the research need to weigh the evidence Good research should provide clear insights into the research problem ","date":"2025-03-11T11:34:12+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E8%90%A5%E9%94%80%E5%AD%A6-1/%E5%B0%81%E9%9D%A2_hu_38446184ce5f077b.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E8%90%A5%E9%94%80%E5%AD%A6-1/","title":"市场营销学 1"},{"content":"Introduction Understand how to represent business processes using the entity-relationship model Implement a database design using MySQL workbench Learn to query a database using SQL Understand new trends and technologies for database Why database?

The E-R model is expressed in terms of entities in the business environment, the relationships (or associations) among those entities, and the attributes (or properties) of both the entities and their relationships. An E-R model is normally expressed as an entity-relationship diagram (e-r diagram, or erD), which is a graphical Why E-R model?\nA crucial tool for understanding and communicating complex data structures to both technical and non-technical stakeholders It helps to build a well-organized and efficient database! Entities Requirements: Employees are assigned to projects. For employees we record their employee ID, first name, and last name. For each project we record a project ID and project description. One project must have at least one employee, one employee can be assigned to at most one project. Entities represent real-world objects; things which can be named: Entity type: collection of entities, e.g. employee, customer, sale (often corresponds to a table) Entity” is usually used for “Entity type” Entity instance: person, place, object, event, concept SHOULD BE:\nAn object that will have many instances in the database An object that will be composed of multiple attributes An object that we are trying to model SHOULD NOT BE:\nA user of the database system An output of the database system (e.g., a report) Relationship Description: Relationship type is a set of associations among entity types Each relationship is described by a name Example: Customer Product Customers Buys Product Product is_Purchased_by Customer \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo; is usually used for \u0026ldquo;relationship type\u0026rdquo; Symbol: Straight line labeled with the name Cardinality Cardinality Constraints 基数约束 the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity Minimum cardinality If zero, then optional If one or more, then mandatory 强制的 Maximum cardinality The maximum number: one or many Why Cardinality?\nData integrity and constraint enforcement Database and query efficiency Scalability Maximum cardinality One-to-One (1:1) Each entity instance in the relationship will have a maximum of one related entity instance e.g., each student has a student account One-to-Many (1:M) An entity instance on one side of the relationship can have many (more than one) related entity instances, but an entity instance on the other side will have a maximum of one (at most one) related entity instance e.g., each department has many instructors Many-to-Many (M:M) Entity instances on both sides of the relationship can have many related entity instances on the other side e.g., many students take many courses Attribute Description Property or characteristic of an entity type (often corresponds to a field in a table) they will be used for actual communication about the real - world phenomena represented by entities and relationships Symbol: Text inside the associated entity rectangle Classifications of attributes Required versus Optional Attributes Simple versus Composite Attributes An attribute broken into component parts Composite key attribute Single-Valued { } ersus Multivalued Attribute [ ] Stored versus Derived Attributes 存储属性与派生属性 Identifier Attributes Keys Identifier 标识符 An attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies individual instances of an entity type Will not change in value Will not be null No intelligent identifiers (e.g., containing locations or people that might change) Substitute new, simple keys for long, composite keys Candidate key 候选键 All available unique, required identifiers to an entity Primary key 主键 The best one among the candidate key ER Modeling Part 2 Modeling relationship Relationship Types vs. Relationship Instances The relationship type is modeled as lines between entity types The relationship instance is between specific entity instances Two entities can have more than one type of relationship between them (multiple relationships) Degree of relationships: the number of entity types that participate in it Relationships can have attributes Associative Entity – combination of relationship and entity Degree of relationships Degree of a relationship is the number of entity types that participate in it Unary relationship Binary relationship Ternary relationship Attributes on relationships Attributes\nCan be associated with entities Can also be assigned to relationships A binary relationship with an attribute\nHere, the date completed attribute pertains specifically to the employee’s completion of a course It is an attribute of the relationship An associative entity\nAssociative entity is like a relationship with an attribute, but it is also considered to be an entity in its own right Note that the many-to-many cardinality between entities has been replaced by two one-to-many relationships with the associative entity Associative entities\nWhen should we use an Associative Entity? All relationships for the associative entity should be many. The associative entity could have meanings independent of the other entities. The associative entity preferably has a unique identifier, and should also have other attributes. The associative entity may participate in other relationships other than the entities of the associated relationship. Supertypes and subtypes Why Super and Subtypes?\nAvoids redundant data\nSupports specialization and generalization\nImproves query efficiency\nA query for all employees can be performed on the employee table, without needing to check each subtype separately Allows for flexible business rules\nE.g., Assistant \u0026amp; Skill Define a subtype (specialization) when:\nThe subtype has additional attributes of interest (e.g., billing rate is recorded for consultants only) and/or The subtype participants in additional relationships Enhanced ER model\nExtends original ER model with new modeling constructs Subtype\nA subgrouping of the entities in an entity type that has attributes distinct from those in other subgrouping Supertype\nA generic entity type that has a relationship with one or more subtypes Attribute inheritance\nSubtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype Attribute inheritance An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype e.g., if ‘Michael’ is in subtype Manager, the data object is also in supertype Employee Subtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype possesses subtype-specific attributes Relationships and subtypes Relationships at the supertype level indicate that ALL subtypes will participate in the relationship The instances of a subtype may participate in a relationship UNIQUE to that subtype. In this situation, the relationship is shown at the subtype level Specialization process Specialization: the process of maximizing the differences between members of an entity by identifying their distinguishing characteristics Specialization is a top-down approach to: Defining a set of supertypes Defining a subtype when It has additional attributes of interest It participates in additional relationships Generalization process Generalization is the reverse of the specialization process 泛化是特化过程的反向操作 Generalization: the process of minimizing the differences between entities by identifying their common characteristics (common attributes and relationships) Generalization is a bottom-up approach to identifying several entities identifying a generalized supertype from these entities Strong vs. Weak entities Strong entities exist independently of other types of entities has its own unique identifier represented with single-line rectangle Weak entities dependent on a strong entity\u0026hellip;cannot exist on its own does not have a unique identifier represented with double-line rectangle Identifying relationship links strong entities to weak entities represented with double line Assignment 1 Exercise 1 3C is a consulting company in Newark. It needs a database to keep track of the assignment of employees to projects. For each employee, 3C wants to record an employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday. For each project, 3C wants to record a project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date. Employees are included in the database even when they have not been assigned to any project. A project must have at least one employee assigned. An employee’s billing rate (the price they charge client for their services) may vary by projects, and 3C wishes to record the applicable billing rate for each employee when assigned to different projects (Hint: Add relationship attributes).\n对于每位employee，3C希望记录 employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday 对于每个Project，3C希望记录project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date 即使员工尚未被分配到任何项目，也会将其纳入数据库 一个项目必须至少分配一名员工 员工的计费费率 employee\u0026rsquo;s billing rate（他们为其服务向客户收取的价格）可能因项目而异 3C 希望记录每个员工在被分配到不同项目时的适用计费费率 Exercise 2 A restaurant is looking to enhance its inventory tracking and optimize sales. One crucial aspect of this system is the relationship between orders and products. Each order has OrderID and Date. Each Product has Product ID and Product Name. The information about a product can be recorded before it is included in any order. The same product can be part of multiple orders. Additionally, some products are composed of multiple other products (e.g., Big Mac Value Meal).\nProduct Big Mac (ProductID: 1003) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 4806 Sesame Seed Bun 1 each 5890 10:1 Patty 2 each 6515 Cheese 2 slice 9875 Dehydrated Onions 1 oz 4050 Lettuce 2 oz 7432 Special Sauce 2 Tbsp 5315 Salt 0.5 Tsp Small Fries (ProductID: 143) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 5315 Salt 0.25 Tsp 7499 Potato 10 oz Small Diet Coke (ProductID: 2499) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1978 Diet Coke Syrup 0.5 Tsp 1277 Water 12 oz Happy Meal (ProductID: 9444) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 522 Cheeseburger 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 small 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each Big Mac Value Meal (ProductID: 2911) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1003 Big Mac 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 each 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each 每个 Order 都有 OrderID \u0026amp; Date 每个 Product 都有 Product ID \u0026amp; Product Name 产品信息可在其被纳入任何订单之前记录 部分产品由多个其他产品组成 Exercise 3 The 3C company would like to record the information about its employees (either fulltime or part-time) in an enterprise information system. For all employees, they record SSN (unique for each employee), name, address, date-of-birth and degree. They record the salary and date hired for fulltime employees only. Further, the bonus of all managers (who are fulltime employees) has to be recorded. Bonus is not recorded for other fulltime employees (e.g., engineers); for managers only. 3C also records hourly wage for part-time employees. 3C would like to record additional information for interns and custodians (both part-time employees). For interns, the number of hours per week and the manager they work for need to be recorded. An intern is assigned to at least one manager. If an intern works for more than one manager, 3C needs to record how many hours (a week) the intern works for each manager. Not all managers have interns. A few managers have more than one intern. For custodians the shift time need to be recorded.\n所有员工：记录社会安全号码（SSN，每位员工唯一）、姓名、地址、出生日期和学位 全职员工：除上述信息外，还记录工资和雇佣日期。其中，经理（属于全职员工）需额外记录奖金，其他全职员工（如工程师）不记录奖金 兼职员工：记录小时工资。对于实习生和管理员这两类兼职员工，还需记录额外信息 实习生：记录每周工作小时数，以及为之工作的经理。实习生至少被分配给一位经理，若为多位经理工作，需记录为每位经理工作的每周时长。并非所有经理都有实习生，部分经理有多名实习生 管理员：记录轮班时间 Exercise 4 An international school of technology has hired you to create a database management system to assist in scheduling classes. After several interviews with the president, you have come up with the following list of entities, attributes, and initial business rules:\nRoom is identified by BID and Room No and also has a Capacity. A room can be either a lab or a classroom. If it is a classroom, it has an additional attribute called Board Type. Media is identified by MID and has attributes of Media Type and Type Description. Note: Here we are tracking type of media (such as a VCR, projector, etc.), not the individual piece of equipment. Tracking of equipment is outside of the scope of this project. Computer is identified by CID and has attributes Computer Type, Type Description, Disk Capacity, and Processor Speed. Please note: As with Media Type, we are tracking only the type of computer, not an individual computer. You can think of this as a class of computers (e.g., Core™ i7 2.6GHz) Instructor has identifier EID and has attributes Name, Rank, and Office Phone. Course has identifier CourseID (e.g., MIS804) and has attributes Course Description and Credits. Courses can have one, none, or many prerequisites. Courses also have one or more sections. Section has attributes SecID (e.g., 010), Semester, Year, and Enrollment Limit. After some further discussions, you have come up with some additional business rules to help you create the initial design:\nAn instructor teaches one, none, or many sections of a course in a given semester. A room can be scheduled for many sections or no section in a given semester of a given year. However, one section can only be scheduled in one room. A room can have one type of media, several types of media, or no media. Instructors are trained to use one, none, or many types of media. A lab has one or more computer types.

Conceptual data modeling is about understanding the organization—getting the requirements right They show how data is connected and how changes to one area of the system can impact other areas helps ensure data integrity, as it provides a way to ensure data is consistent and accurate across the system We focus on the relational data model based on mathematical theory and therefore has a solid theoretical foundation Relation Definition: A relation is a named, two-dimensional table of data Table consists of rows (records), and columns (attribute or field) Relations (tables) correspond with entity types实体类型 and with relationships types关系类型 Rows correspond with entity instances and with relationship instances Columns correspond with attributes Note: The word relation (in relational database) is NOT the same as the word relationship (in E-R model) Relational Model Step 1: Strong entity and attributes\nStep 2: Binary relationships\nStep 2.1: One-to-many relationships FK on the M-side Primary key on the one side becomes a foreign key on the many side No null value in the foreign key \u0026mdash; this is because of the mandatory minimum cardinality Step 2.2: One-to-one relationships FK on the optional side Step 2.3: Many-to-Many relationships Add a new relation (with PFKs) Step 3: Weak entity\nA separate relation with a foreign key taken from the strong entity A new relation with FK from the strong entity as part of its PK (PFK) Step 4: Unary/recursive relationships 一元/递归关系\nOne-to-many -\u0026gt; one relation with FK\nMany-to-many -\u0026gt; add a new relation (with PFKs)\nStep 5: Multi-valued attributes 多值属性\nMultivalued attribute becomes a separate relation with foreign key A new relation with PFK Step 6: Supertypes and subtypes\nOne relation for supertype and for each subtype Supertype attributes go into supertype relation Subtype attributes go into each subtype; primary key of supertype relation also becomes primary key of subtype relation 1:1 relationship established between supertype and each subtype, with supertype as primary table PFK in each subtype Integrity Constraints Entity Integrity No primary key attribute may be null. All primary key fields MUST have data Referential Integrity Any foreign key value MUST match a primary key value (or the foreign key can be null) e.g. Delete Rules Restrict – don’t allow delete of “customer” side if related rows exist in “order” side Cascade – automatically delete “order” side rows that correspond with the “customer” side row to be deleted Set-to-Null – set the foreign key in the dependent side to null if deleting from the “customer” side → not allowed for weak entities Many-to-many(M:N) Highlights Always adding another relation (table/associative entity) to convert a M:N relationship to two 1:M relationships MySQL workbench will automatically generate a new table if you choose M:N relationship between two tables! Be careful about the changes in Cardinalities M:N -\u0026gt; 1:M The minimum cardinalities need to be adjusted accordingly – Swap Identifying vs Non-identifying relationship Identifying relationship - where the child entity\u0026rsquo;s identity/existence relies solely on the parent entity. No parent entity means no child entity For an identifying relationship, you put the primary key column from the parent into the primary key column of the child (along with other columns needed to provide uniqueness) For a non-identifying relationship, you put the primary key column of the parent into the table of the child, but not in the primary key Tutorial File → new model 外观设置 Model → Model Options → Diagram → 不勾选 Show Column Types → 勾选 Show Captions Model → Object Notation → 勾选 ID1F1X Model → Relationship Notation → 勾选 Crow\u0026rsquo;s Foot (IE) Normalization Logical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization Normalization in database design Normalization Process for evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize data redundancies and ensure data integrity Works through a series of stages called normal forms Normal form Second normal form Third normal form 2 NF is better than 1 NF; 3 NF is better than 2 NF For most business database design purpose, 3 NF is the highest we need to go in the normalization process Highest level of normalization is not always most desirable Different normal forms Conversion to first normal form First Normal Form (1NF) Each row has a PK value Every column should have single values No repeating groups (columns) Anomalies 异常 Anomalies are issues caused by redundant data Insertion annomalies Modification anomalies Deletion anomalies Functional dependency (FD) 函数依赖\nThe value of one attribute (the determinant: e.g., A ) determines the value of another attribute (e.g., B) (denoted A -\u0026gt; B)\nWe should identify functional dependencies that hold for all possible values relation NF Problem – Partial dependencies\n1 NF tables are still subject to data redundancies -\u0026gt; anomalies Partial dependencies: Only part of the PK can determine some non-primary key attributes some non-primary key attributes are functionally dependent on only part of the PK Transformation between normal forms Convert 1NF to 2NF Second Normal Form (2NF): every non-PK attribute is fully functionally dependent on the PK\nA relation with a single attribute PK is automatically in 2 NF Step1: Identify all dependencies\nFDs (from business rules): courseNo, sectionNo → title, units, deptCode, instructorID, fName, lName courseNo → title, units, deptCode instructorID → fName, lName FD diagram Depicts all dependencies found within a given table structure Helpful in getting bird’s-eye view of all relationships among a table’s attributes Step2: Remove partial dependency\nWrite the determinant of the partial dependency the key of a new relation Place the dependent attributes on a separate line as in the partial dependency in the new relation along with their determinant Keep the rest of the original relation Convert 2NF to 3NF A table is in third normal form (3NF) if: It is in 2NF and no non-PK attribute is transitively dependent on the PK Step 1: Identify transitive dependencies For every transitive dependency, write its determinant Step 2: Remove transitive dependencies as a PK for a new table Place the dependent attributes in the transitive dependency in the new table identified in step1 Keep the rest of the other tables Normalization and database design Normalization should be part of the design process\nMake sure that proposed entities meet required normal form before table structures are created\nMany real-world databases have been improperly designed or burdened with anomalies if improperly modified during course of time\nYou may be asked to redesign and modify existing databases\nE-R diagram\nProvides the big picture, or macro view, of an organization’s data requirements and operations Created through an iterative process\nIdentifying relevant entities, their attributes and their relationship Use results to identify additional entities and attributes Normalization procedures\nFocus on the characteristics of specific entities A micro view of the entities within the ER diagram Difficult to separate normalization process from ER modeling process\nTwo techniques should be used concurrently\nSummary Normalization is a table design technique aimed at minimizing data redundancies First three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) are most commonly encountered Normalization is an important part—but only a part—of the design process Continue the iterative ER process until all entities and their attributes are defined and all equivalent tables are in 3NF Assignment 2 Exercise 1 Logical Data Model Exercise 2 Logical Data Model Exercise 3 Logical Data Model Exercise 4 Logical Data Model ","date":"2025-03-10T15:56:56+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/title_hu_e240d0350799f182.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/","title":"实体关系建模"},{"content":"Networking Fundamentals Network \u0026amp;

Application Layer Protocols - HTTP Web and HTTP First, some jargon:\nA web page consists of objects. An object can be an HTML file, a JPEG image, a Java applet, an audio file, etc. A web page consists of a base HTML file which includes several referenced objects. Each object is addressable by a URL. Example URL: HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol\nWeb’s application layer protocol\nclient/server model\nclient: browser that requests, receives, \u0026ldquo;displays\u0026rdquo; Web objects server: Web server sends objects in response to requests HTTP 1.0: RFC 1945\nHTTP 1.1: RFC 2068\nHTTP request message two types of HTTP messages: request, response HTTP request message: ASCII (human-readable format) general format Method types HTTP/1.1 GET POST HEAD PUT uploads file in entity body to path specified in URL field DELETE asks server to leave requested object out of response deletes file specified in the URL field HTTP/1.0 GET, POST, HEAD Uploading from input Post method: Web page often includes form input Input is uploaded to server in entity body URL method: Uses GET method Input is uploaded in URL field of request line HTTP response message In first line in server-\u0026gt;client response message. A few sample codes: 200 OK request succeeded, requested object later in this message 301 Moved Permanently requested object moved, new location specified later in this message (Location:) 400 Bad Request request message not understood by server 404 Not Found requested document not found on this server 505 HTTP Version Not Supported HTTP/2 HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015. HTTP/2 allows the server to \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; content, that is, to respond with data for more queries than the client requested.

anything unencrypted that is transmitted over the network) by malicious hackers Tools Wireshark Display Filter Note the box at the top of Wireshark for display filters Select only some of the packets captured for display The comparison operators can be expressed either through C-like symbols, or through English-like abbreviations: 1 2 3 4 5 6 eq, == Equal ne, != Not equal gt, \u0026gt;
