Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational goals. The Marketinig Process Understanding the Marketplace and Customer Needs Customer Needs, Wants, and Demands Needs are states of deprivation Physical - food, clothing, warmth, safety Social - belonging and affection Individual - Knowledge and self-expression Wants are the form that needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality Demands are wants backed by buying power You need to be able to communicate with your friends \u0026amp; family.

The primary purpose of a DBMS is to provide a systematic method of creating, updating, storing, and retrieving the data stored in a database. A software package that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to the database. Database System: a computerized record-keeping system, containing database and DBMS as well as some other components (e.g., hardware) Advantages of database approach Reduce but not eliminate redundancy all data items are integrated with a minimum amount of duplication Sharing of data the database is owned and accessed by the entire organization Data consistency management system reduces the risk of inconsistencies occurring Improved data accessibility due to data integration and query languages like SQL Specific steps Requirements Analysis Collect and analyze the business requirements Conceptual Design Design a conceptual model, e.g., ER model Logical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization Database Building (Physical Design) Build the database and write application programs Operation, Maintenance, \u0026amp; Tuning Use, maintain, and “tune” the database A good business rule Declarative – what, not how Precise – clear, agreed-upon meaning Atomic – one statement Consistent – internally and externally Expressible – structured, natural language Distinct – non-redundant Business-oriented – understood by business people Data definitions Explanation of a term or fact Term—word or phrase with specific meaning Fact—association between two or more terms Examples of facts: A course is a module of instruction in a particular subject area.

The E-R model is expressed in terms of entities in the business environment, the relationships (or associations) among those entities, and the attributes (or properties) of both the entities and their relationships. An E-R model is normally expressed as an entity-relationship diagram (e-r diagram, or erD), which is a graphical Why E-R model?\nA crucial tool for understanding and communicating complex data structures to both technical and non-technical stakeholders It helps to build a well-organized and efficient database! Entities Requirements: Employees are assigned to projects. For employees we record their employee ID, first name, and last name. For each project we record a project ID and project description. One project must have at least one employee, one employee can be assigned to at most one project. Entities represent real-world objects; things which can be named: Entity type: collection of entities, e.g. employee, customer, sale (often corresponds to a table) Entity” is usually used for “Entity type” Entity instance: person, place, object, event, concept SHOULD BE:\nAn object that will have many instances in the database An object that will be composed of multiple attributes An object that we are trying to model SHOULD NOT BE:\nA user of the database system An output of the database system (e.g., a report) Relationship Description: Relationship type is a set of associations among entity types Each relationship is described by a name Example: Customer Product Customers Buys Product Product is_Purchased_by Customer \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo; is usually used for \u0026ldquo;relationship type\u0026rdquo; Symbol: Straight line labeled with the name Cardinality Cardinality Constraints 基数约束 the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity Minimum cardinality If zero, then optional If one or more, then mandatory 强制的 Maximum cardinality The maximum number: one or many Why Cardinality?\nData integrity and constraint enforcement Database and query efficiency Scalability Maximum cardinality One-to-One (1:1) Each entity instance in the relationship will have a maximum of one related entity instance e.g., each student has a student account One-to-Many (1:M) An entity instance on one side of the relationship can have many (more than one) related entity instances, but an entity instance on the other side will have a maximum of one (at most one) related entity instance e.g., each department has many instructors Many-to-Many (M:M) Entity instances on both sides of the relationship can have many related entity instances on the other side e.g., many students take many courses Attribute Description Property or characteristic of an entity type (often corresponds to a field in a table) they will be used for actual communication about the real - world phenomena represented by entities and relationships Symbol: Text inside the associated entity rectangle Classifications of attributes Required versus Optional Attributes Simple versus Composite Attributes An attribute broken into component parts Composite key attribute Single-Valued { } ersus Multivalued Attribute [ ] Stored versus Derived Attributes 存储属性与派生属性 Identifier Attributes Keys Identifier 标识符 An attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies individual instances of an entity type Will not change in value Will not be null No intelligent identifiers (e.g., containing locations or people that might change) Substitute new, simple keys for long, composite keys Candidate key 候选键 All available unique, required identifiers to an entity Primary key 主键 The best one among the candidate key ER Modeling Part 2 Modeling relationship Relationship Types vs. Relationship Instances The relationship type is modeled as lines between entity types The relationship instance is between specific entity instances Two entities can have more than one type of relationship between them (multiple relationships) Degree of relationships: the number of entity types that participate in it Relationships can have attributes Associative Entity – combination of relationship and entity Degree of relationships Degree of a relationship is the number of entity types that participate in it Unary relationship Binary relationship Ternary relationship Attributes on relationships Attributes\nCan be associated with entities Can also be assigned to relationships A binary relationship with an attribute\nHere, the date completed attribute pertains specifically to the employee’s completion of a course It is an attribute of the relationship An associative entity\nAssociative entity is like a relationship with an attribute, but it is also considered to be an entity in its own right Note that the many-to-many cardinality between entities has been replaced by two one-to-many relationships with the associative entity Associative entities\nWhen should we use an Associative Entity? All relationships for the associative entity should be many. The associative entity could have meanings independent of the other entities. The associative entity preferably has a unique identifier, and should also have other attributes. The associative entity may participate in other relationships other than the entities of the associated relationship. Supertypes and subtypes Why Super and Subtypes?\nAvoids redundant data\nSupports specialization and generalization\nImproves query efficiency\nA query for all employees can be performed on the employee table, without needing to check each subtype separately Allows for flexible business rules\nE.g., Assistant \u0026amp; Skill Define a subtype (specialization) when:\nThe subtype has additional attributes of interest (e.g., billing rate is recorded for consultants only) and/or The subtype participants in additional relationships Enhanced ER model\nExtends original ER model with new modeling constructs Subtype\nA subgrouping of the entities in an entity type that has attributes distinct from those in other subgrouping Supertype\nA generic entity type that has a relationship with one or more subtypes Attribute inheritance\nSubtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype Attribute inheritance An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype e.g., if ‘Michael’ is in subtype Manager, the data object is also in supertype Employee Subtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype possesses subtype-specific attributes Relationships and subtypes Relationships at the supertype level indicate that ALL subtypes will participate in the relationship The instances of a subtype may participate in a relationship UNIQUE to that subtype. In this situation, the relationship is shown at the subtype level Specialization process Specialization: the process of maximizing the differences between members of an entity by identifying their distinguishing characteristics Specialization is a top-down approach to: Defining a set of supertypes Defining a subtype when It has additional attributes of interest It participates in additional relationships Generalization process Generalization is the reverse of the specialization process 泛化是特化过程的反向操作 Generalization: the process of minimizing the differences between entities by identifying their common characteristics (common attributes and relationships) Generalization is a bottom-up approach to identifying several entities identifying a generalized supertype from these entities Strong vs. Weak entities Strong entities exist independently of other types of entities has its own unique identifier represented with single-line rectangle Weak entities dependent on a strong entity\u0026hellip;cannot exist on its own does not have a unique identifier represented with double-line rectangle Identifying relationship links strong entities to weak entities represented with double line Assignment 1 Exercise 1 3C is a consulting company in Newark. It needs a database to keep track of the assignment of employees to projects. For each employee, 3C wants to record an employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday. For each project, 3C wants to record a project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date. Employees are included in the database even when they have not been assigned to any project. A project must have at least one employee assigned. An employee’s billing rate (the price they charge client for their services) may vary by projects, and 3C wishes to record the applicable billing rate for each employee when assigned to different projects (Hint: Add relationship attributes).\n对于每位employee，3C希望记录 employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday 对于每个Project，3C希望记录project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date 即使员工尚未被分配到任何项目，也会将其纳入数据库 一个项目必须至少分配一名员工 员工的计费费率 employee\u0026rsquo;s billing rate（他们为其服务向客户收取的价格）可能因项目而异 3C 希望记录每个员工在被分配到不同项目时的适用计费费率 Exercise 2 A restaurant is looking to enhance its inventory tracking and optimize sales. One crucial aspect of this system is the relationship between orders and products. Each order has OrderID and Date. Each Product has Product ID and Product Name. The information about a product can be recorded before it is included in any order. The same product can be part of multiple orders. Additionally, some products are composed of multiple other products (e.g., Big Mac Value Meal).\nProduct Big Mac (ProductID: 1003) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 4806 Sesame Seed Bun 1 each 5890 10:1 Patty 2 each 6515 Cheese 2 slice 9875 Dehydrated Onions 1 oz 4050 Lettuce 2 oz 7432 Special Sauce 2 Tbsp 5315 Salt 0.5 Tsp Small Fries (ProductID: 143) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 5315 Salt 0.25 Tsp 7499 Potato 10 oz Small Diet Coke (ProductID: 2499) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1978 Diet Coke Syrup 0.5 Tsp 1277 Water 12 oz Happy Meal (ProductID: 9444) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 522 Cheeseburger 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 small 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each Big Mac Value Meal (ProductID: 2911) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1003 Big Mac 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 each 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each 每个 Order 都有 OrderID \u0026amp; Date 每个 Product 都有 Product ID \u0026amp; Product Name 产品信息可在其被纳入任何订单之前记录 部分产品由多个其他产品组成 Exercise 3 The 3C company would like to record the information about its employees (either fulltime or part-time) in an enterprise information system. For all employees, they record SSN (unique for each employee), name, address, date-of-birth and degree. They record the salary and date hired for fulltime employees only. Further, the bonus of all managers (who are fulltime employees) has to be recorded. Bonus is not recorded for other fulltime employees (e.g., engineers); for managers only. 3C also records hourly wage for part-time employees. 3C would like to record additional information for interns and custodians (both part-time employees). For interns, the number of hours per week and the manager they work for need to be recorded. An intern is assigned to at least one manager. If an intern works for more than one manager, 3C needs to record how many hours (a week) the intern works for each manager. Not all managers have interns. A few managers have more than one intern. For custodians the shift time need to be recorded.\n所有员工：记录社会安全号码（SSN，每位员工唯一）、姓名、地址、出生日期和学位 全职员工：除上述信息外，还记录工资和雇佣日期。其中，经理（属于全职员工）需额外记录奖金，其他全职员工（如工程师）不记录奖金 兼职员工：记录小时工资。对于实习生和管理员这两类兼职员工，还需记录额外信息 实习生：记录每周工作小时数，以及为之工作的经理。实习生至少被分配给一位经理，若为多位经理工作，需记录为每位经理工作的每周时长。并非所有经理都有实习生，部分经理有多名实习生 管理员：记录轮班时间 Exercise 4 An international school of technology has hired you to create a database management system to assist in scheduling classes. After several interviews with the president, you have come up with the following list of entities, attributes, and initial business rules:\nRoom is identified by BID and Room No and also has a Capacity. A room can be either a lab or a classroom. If it is a classroom, it has an additional attribute called Board Type. Media is identified by MID and has attributes of Media Type and Type Description. Note: Here we are tracking type of media (such as a VCR, projector, etc.), not the individual piece of equipment. Tracking of equipment is outside of the scope of this project. Computer is identified by CID and has attributes Computer Type, Type Description, Disk Capacity, and Processor Speed. Please note: As with Media Type, we are tracking only the type of computer, not an individual computer. You can think of this as a class of computers (e.g., Core™ i7 2.6GHz) Instructor has identifier EID and has attributes Name, Rank, and Office Phone. Course has identifier CourseID (e.g., MIS804) and has attributes Course Description and Credits. Courses can have one, none, or many prerequisites. Courses also have one or more sections. Section has attributes SecID (e.g., 010), Semester, Year, and Enrollment Limit. After some further discussions, you have come up with some additional business rules to help you create the initial design:\nAn instructor teaches one, none, or many sections of a course in a given semester. A room can be scheduled for many sections or no section in a given semester of a given year. However, one section can only be scheduled in one room. A room can have one type of media, several types of media, or no media. Instructors are trained to use one, none, or many types of media. A lab has one or more computer types. However, a classroom does not have any computers. A room cannot be both a classroom and a lab. There also are no other room types to be incorporated into the system. Room: BID \u0026amp; Room No, Capacity lab classroom: Board Type Media: MID, Media Type, Type Description Computer: CID, Computer Type, Type Description, Disk Capacity, Processor Speed Instructor: EID, Name, Rank, and Office Phone Course: CourseID, Course Description, Credits Section: SecID, Semester, Year, and Enrollment Limit Translating ER Model into Relational Model Logical Design How to connect multiple entities?\nHow to ensure data integrity?\nLogical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization What is logical design?\nLogical database design is about creating stable database structures— correctly expressing the requirements in a technical language. Conceptual data modeling is about understanding the organization—getting the requirements right They show how data is connected and how changes to one area of the system can impact other areas helps ensure data integrity, as it provides a way to ensure data is consistent and accurate across the system We focus on the relational data model based on mathematical theory and therefore has a solid theoretical foundation Relation Definition: A relation is a named, two-dimensional table of data Table consists of rows (records), and columns (attribute or field) Relations (tables) correspond with entity types实体类型 and with relationships types关系类型 Rows correspond with entity instances and with relationship instances Columns correspond with attributes Note: The word relation (in relational database) is NOT the same as the word relationship (in E-R model) Relational Model Step 1: Strong entity and attributes\nStep 2: Binary relationships\nStep 2.1: One-to-many relationships FK on the M-side Primary key on the one side becomes a foreign key on the many side No null value in the foreign key \u0026mdash; this is because of the mandatory minimum cardinality Step 2.2: One-to-one relationships FK on the optional side Step 2.3: Many-to-Many relationships Add a new relation (with PFKs) Step 3: Weak entity\nA separate relation with a foreign key taken from the strong entity A new relation with FK from the strong entity as part of its PK (PFK) Step 4: Unary/recursive relationships 一元/递归关系\nOne-to-many -\u0026gt; one relation with FK\nMany-to-many -\u0026gt; add a new relation (with PFKs)\nStep 5: Multi-valued attributes 多值属性\nMultivalued attribute becomes a separate relation with foreign key A new relation with PFK Step 6: Supertypes and subtypes\nOne relation for supertype and for each subtype Supertype attributes go into supertype relation Subtype attributes go into each subtype; primary key of supertype relation also becomes primary key of subtype relation 1:1 relationship established between supertype and each subtype, with supertype as primary table PFK in each subtype Integrity Constraints Entity Integrity No primary key attribute may be null. All primary key fields MUST have data Referential Integrity Any foreign key value MUST match a primary key value (or the foreign key can be null) e.g. Delete Rules Restrict – don’t allow delete of “customer” side if related rows exist in “order” side Cascade – automatically delete “order” side rows that correspond with the “customer” side row to be deleted Set-to-Null – set the foreign key in the dependent side to null if deleting from the “customer” side → not allowed for weak entities Many-to-many(M:N) Highlights Always adding another relation (table/associative entity) to convert a M:N relationship to two 1:M relationships MySQL workbench will automatically generate a new table if you choose M:N relationship between two tables! Be careful about the changes in Cardinalities M:N -\u0026gt; 1:M The minimum cardinalities need to be adjusted accordingly – Swap Identifying vs Non-identifying relationship Identifying relationship - where the child entity\u0026rsquo;s identity/existence relies solely on the parent entity. No parent entity means no child entity For an identifying relationship, you put the primary key column from the parent into the primary key column of the child (along with other columns needed to provide uniqueness) For a non-identifying relationship, you put the primary key column of the parent into the table of the child, but not in the primary key Normalization Logical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization Normalization in database design Normalization Process for evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize data redundancies and ensure data integrity Works through a series of stages called normal forms Normal form Second normal form Third normal form 2 NF is better than 1 NF; 3 NF is better than 2 NF For most business database design purpose, 3 NF is the highest we need to go in the normalization process Highest level of normalization is not always most desirable Different normal forms Conversion to first normal form First Normal Form (1NF) Each row has a PK value Every column should have single values No repeating groups (columns) Anomalies 异常 Anomalies are issues caused by redundant data Insertion annomalies Modification anomalies Deletion anomalies Functional dependency (FD) 函数依赖\nThe value of one attribute (the determinant: e.g., A ) determines the value of another attribute (e.g., B) (denoted A -\u0026gt; B)\nWe should identify functional dependencies that hold for all possible values relation NF Problem – Partial dependencies\n1 NF tables are still subject to data redundancies -\u0026gt; anomalies Partial dependencies: Only part of the PK can determine some non-primary key attributes some non-primary key attributes are functionally dependent on only part of the PK Transformation between normal forms Convert 1NF to 2NF Second Normal Form (2NF): every non-PK attribute is fully functionally dependent on the PK\nA relation with a single attribute PK is automatically in 2 NF Step1: Identify all dependencies\nFDs (from business rules): courseNo, sectionNo → title, units, deptCode, instructorID, fName, lName courseNo → title, units, deptCode instructorID → fName, lName FD diagram Depicts all dependencies found within a given table structure Helpful in getting bird’s-eye view of all relationships among a table’s attributes Step2: Remove partial dependency\nWrite the determinant of the partial dependency the key of a new relation Place the dependent attributes on a separate line as in the partial dependency in the new relation along with their determinant Keep the rest of the original relation Convert 2NF to 3NF A table is in third normal form (3NF) if: It is in 2NF and no non-PK attribute is transitively dependent on the PK Step 1: Identify transitive dependencies For every transitive dependency, write its determinant Step 2: Remove transitive dependencies as a PK for a new table Place the dependent attributes in the transitive dependency in the new table identified in step1 Keep the rest of the other tables Normalization and database design Normalization should be part of the design process\nMake sure that proposed entities meet required normal form before table structures are created\nMany real-world databases have been improperly designed or burdened with anomalies if improperly modified during course of time\nYou may be asked to redesign and modify existing databases\nE-R diagram\nProvides the big picture, or macro view, of an organization’s data requirements and operations Created through an iterative process\nIdentifying relevant entities, their attributes and their relationship Use results to identify additional entities and attributes Normalization procedures\nFocus on the characteristics of specific entities A micro view of the entities within the ER diagram Difficult to separate normalization process from ER modeling process\nTwo techniques should be used concurrently\nSummary Normalization is a table design technique aimed at minimizing data redundancies First three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) are most commonly encountered Normalization is an important part—but only a part—of the design process Continue the iterative ER process until all entities and their attributes are defined and all equivalent tables are in 3NF Assignment 2 Exercise 1 Logical Data Model Exercise 2 Logical Data Model Exercise 3 Logical Data Model Exercise 4 Logical Data Model ","date":"2025-03-10T15:56:56+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/title_hu_e240d0350799f182.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/","title":"实体关系建模"},{"content":"Networking Fundamentals Network \u0026amp;

Mail message format SMTP [RFC 821]: protocol for exchanging email message\nRFC 822: standard for text message\nheader lines\nTo: From: Subject: different from SMTP commands\nbody\nthe \u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;, ASCII characters only MIME: multimedia mail extension, RFC 2045, 2056\nadditional lines in message header declare MIME content type Scenario: Alice sends message to Bob Alice uses her User Agent (UA) to compose a message and sets the \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; field as \u0026ldquo;bob@someschool.edu\u0026rdquo;. Alice\u0026rsquo;s UA sends the message to her mail server, and the message is placed in the message queue. The client - side of SMTP opens a TCP connection with Bob\u0026rsquo;s mail server. User Agent - Mail Server The SMTP client sends Alice\u0026rsquo;s message over the TCP connection. Bob\u0026rsquo;s mail server places the message in Bob\u0026rsquo;s mailbox. Bob invokes his User Agent to read the message. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) deliver and store emails to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s server. Email Access Protocols: retrieval from server POP (Post Office Protocol, based on RFC 1939 standard) authorization process between the user agent and the server to achieve the function of downloading emails. IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol, based on RFC 1730 standard) more features (more complex). manipulation of stored msgs on server HTTP Hotmail, Yahoo!Mail POP3 \u0026ldquo;download and delete\u0026rdquo; mode You cannot re-read e mail if you changes client \u0026ldquo;download-and keep\u0026rdquo; mode copies of messages on different clients POP3 is stateless across sessions IMAP Keep all messages in one place: the server. Allow users to organize messages in folders. IMAP maintains the user state across sessions: names of folders and the mappings between message IDs and folders. Application Layer Protocols - HTTP Web and HTTP First, some jargon:\nA web page consists of objects. An object can be an HTML file, a JPEG image, a Java applet, an audio file, etc. A web page consists of a base HTML file which includes several referenced objects. Each object is addressable by a URL. Example URL: HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol\nWeb’s application layer protocol\nclient/server model\nclient: browser that requests, receives, \u0026ldquo;displays\u0026rdquo; Web objects server: Web server sends objects in response to requests HTTP 1.0: RFC 1945\nHTTP 1.1: RFC 2068\nHTTP request message two types of HTTP messages: request, response HTTP request message: ASCII (human-readable format) general format Method types HTTP/1.1 GET POST HEAD PUT uploads file in entity body to path specified in URL field DELETE asks server to leave requested object out of response deletes file specified in the URL field HTTP/1.0 GET, POST, HEAD Uploading from input Post method: Web page often includes form input Input is uploaded to server in entity body URL method: Uses GET method Input is uploaded in URL field of request line HTTP response message In first line in server-\u0026gt;client response message. A few sample codes: 200 OK request succeeded, requested object later in this message 301 Moved Permanently requested object moved, new location specified later in this message (Location:) 400 Bad Request request message not understood by server 404 Not Found requested document not found on this server 505 HTTP Version Not Supported HTTP/2 HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015. HTTP/2 allows the server to \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; content, that is, to respond with data for more queries than the client requested. Multiplexing of requests, header compression, and prioritization of request.

These are used by popular applications. Servers/daemons usually use well-known ports. Any client can identify the server/service. Registered port numbers (1024 to 49152) used for less central applications. http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers Ephemeral port numbers: 49153 to 65535 Clients usually use dynamic ports. Assigned by the client kernel at run time.

Sometimes referred to as Network Monitoring Tools Can be used legitimately by network and system administrators to verify network traffic and diagnose problems Can be used to determine what systems and protocols are unprotected/unencrypted in a network and take action (good/bad) Can be used to obtain critical information (passwords, cc numbers; anything unencrypted that is transmitted over the network) by malicious hackers Tools Wireshark Display Filter Note the box at the top of Wireshark for display filters Select only some of the packets captured for display The comparison operators can be expressed either through C-like symbols, or through English-like abbreviations: 1 2 3 4 5 6 eq, == Equal ne, != Not equal gt, \u0026gt;
