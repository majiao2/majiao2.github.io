[{"content":" 鸣谢：\n【转载】如何在“历史垃圾时间”里活下去 原文内容 以史为鉴：做好最坏预期 去对应下90年代初日本和1930年美国的大萧条时期的经济形势和人们的生存状态，提前预判，对极有可能随之而来的类似时期有个心理预期，必要时把生活预期调整为以吃饱饭和能支付的起一间房的房租为目标，不给自己施加任何压力。\n清醒认识：你活在集体精神病院 认识到自己生活在一个巨大的精神病院里。 这个精神病院里主要由自恋型人格障碍的病人（其中一部分还是制定游戏规则的掌权者）+精神被阉割的太监们+正在努力想要成为太监的准太监们以及大批幻想期待渴望从太监那里得到满足的奴婢们组成。 他们互相索取，互相欺骗，互相愚弄，互相撕咬，以彼此拉扯、消耗为生活方式度过一生，如果你不想被裹挟，就要懂得做个安静的，坚定的旁观者，尽可能远离集体，远离人群。\n物理迁徙：用脚投票改变命运 迁徙，家贫走四方，良禽择木而栖，哪里水草充足哪里土壤适合生存就去哪里，对于社会底层的孩子来说，迁徙是最能直接改变命运的路径，地球就是个村。\n精神迁徙：主动脱离系统绑定 肉身无法迁徙的，就从精神上迁徙，精神上脱钩，不和主流社会产生任何强绑定，做到不入局，玩一个失控的游戏就会被失控的游戏规则所牵制束缚带入失控，智者不入哀河。 这里的一切规则，都与我无关。\n降欲修心：切断痛苦代偿循环 降低物欲，要知道高物欲（包括性欲食欲）大多是痛苦内在匮乏的代偿，去解决内在问题，观心修心，接纳容许，看到自己，而不是通过不断喝海水解渴……减少一切不必要的消费，不借！贷！不买房，不做任何投资，除了投资自己。（如增加体能，学习知识、技能，旅行看世界，培养某项爱好等）\n拒绝接盘：破除孝道绑架 上不养老下不养小。 养老从来不是个体的责任，发达国家集举国之力通过几代人的努力打造的社会养老制度托起的重担，放在人类社会任何一个个体身上都等同于要求一个人举起一辆车，哪怕勉强举起来的，最终都会被压垮。逃避不可耻，不需要有任何羞耻感和愧疚感，你的父母也许很可怜，但她们自身活的如此艰难还把你带到这个世上，要你来负担她们的老年生活，不像以前人们普遍寿命短，现代人的寿命到80，90岁已是常态，也就是一个50，60岁的人要负担另外一个人长达20年的老年生活……这类人也不是真正意义上的”父母“，真正意义上的父母是托举是成全孩子，是养育过程中的不求回报，做不到无偿无条件对孩子付出可以选择不生。也只有一代人能够坚持做到上不养老，不去接盘本应该社会承担的责任，那么通过子宫“蓄奴”生孩子当免费护工用的“父母”才会越来越少，生孩子纯粹因为爱和通过养育孩子的过程享受给予的快乐体验，不求回报去成全托举孩子的父母才会越来越多。\n精准结盟：建立生存共同体 学会相信一小部分人，去努力找到价值观一致，生活理念相同志同道合的人，和她们结盟组建生活搭子互相扶持在困难时期活下去，记住，人是因为爱而链接的，不是靠血缘，更加不是靠性，跳出思维框架打开格局，如果找不到也没关系，我们还有自己，还可以跟不同的事产生链接。\n手艺至上：逃离白领绞肉机 去做蓝领的工作。 蓝领工作是随着年龄渐长手艺的娴熟会越来越变得不可替代，不会出现35岁以后就失业的情况，传统教育培养出来的螺丝钉哪里都能钉，他们坐在办公室里的那些工作大多都是可以被更年轻的，更便宜的人工替代，要意识到把人分为三六九等，把职业分为高低贵贱都是为了为了激发你害怕成为弱者，害怕落后的恐惧心理，恐惧是成本最低用来操控人心的工具，把自己从恐惧中解放出来，你不玩“人上人”的游戏，你就不会被成为“人下人”的恐惧支配，靠怕输驱动的“赢”是危房加盖，终究有一天会倒塌，应试教育下的“天子骄子”人到中年的不断陨落已经可以说明一些情况了，毕竟鸡蛋从外打破是食物，从内打破才是生命。\n蛰伏修炼：在阅读中等待转机 大量阅读，阅读是随身携带的避难所，在避难所里蛰伏下去投资身体和大脑，静静等待吧。\n最后年轻人一定不要想着去死，该死的不是我们，我们要好好强身健体等着该死的一个个死去的那一天。\n该死的不是我们 是他们把房价炒成天价，然后嘲笑年轻人不努力；\n是他们把 996 包装成福报，把猝死美化为“奋斗者之光”；\n是他们一边喊着“人口红利”，一边把活生生的人当作消耗品；\n是他们制造焦虑，贩卖解药，再把解药变成新的毒药。\n我们做错了什么？\n我们按时纳税，遵守规则，勤勤恳恳工作。\n我们相信知识改变命运，却发现自己不过是更昂贵的韭菜；\n我们以为勤劳致富，结果只是让老板换了辆更贵的车。\n他们却在私人飞机上高谈阔论“年轻人要吃苦”，\n在游艇上教育我们“要学会延迟满足”，\n用我们的血汗钱买下整个学区房，\n然后说“寒门再难出贵子”。\n该死的不是我们这些想好好生活的人，\n是那些制定规则又随时修改规则的人。\n是那些把社会变成赌场却自己做庄的人，\n是那些吸干年轻人的血还说“这是为你们好“的人。\n但别急着绝望。\n历史告诉我们：\n所有靠压榨维持的系统，\n最终都会死在自己的贪婪里。\n我要做的，\n就是活得比他们长，\n看得比他们远，\n等到大厦崩塌的那天，\n站在废墟上笑着说：\n“看，我说过该死的不是我们。”\n记住：\n狼吃羊的时候，\n从来不会承认自己残暴，\n只会怪羊跑得不够快。\n但草原上的狼，\n最后都变成了标本。\n而羊群，\n永远生生不息。\n在“历史垃圾时间”中保持清醒与韧性 这些生存策略的核心，其实是在一个系统性衰退的时代里，如何避免被吞噬、被异化、被消耗。它们不是消极的躺平，而是一种清醒的自我保护，甚至是一种无声的反抗。\n认清现实，但不被现实驯化 “历史垃圾时间”的本质，是旧秩序在崩塌，而新秩序尚未成型。在这个过渡期，大多数人会被焦虑、恐惧和虚假希望裹挟，成为系统继续运转的燃料。而真正的生存智慧，在于看清游戏的本质后，选择不参与，或者以最小代价参与。\n拒绝被定义，保持流动性 无论是物理迁徙还是精神迁徙，本质都是拒绝被固定在一个注定下沉的船上。现代社会最大的幻觉，就是让人相信“稳定”是常态，而动荡是意外。但历史告诉我们，动荡才是常态，稳定只是短暂的喘息。保持流动性，就是保持选择权。\n低欲望不是放弃，而是战略收缩 高消费社会依赖人的欲望维持运转，而当个人主动降低欲望时，其实是在切断被剥削的链条。这不是贫穷，而是一种资源再分配——把原本被资本收割的金钱和时间，重新投资在自己身上。\n对抗集体癫狂，需要极强的定力 社会是一个巨大的剧场，每个人都在扮演角色，而一旦有人拒绝剧本，就会被视为异类。真正的自由，不是反抗所有人，而是不被任何人的期待绑架，包括亲人和社会的道德勒索。\n最终，活下来就是胜利 在漫长的历史周期里，个体的力量微不足道，但个体的清醒可以成为一种传染性的力量。不要幻想改变世界，但要确保自己不在混乱中崩溃。\n活下来，保持健康，保持思考能力，等待新的可能性出现。\n这不是悲观，而是一种冷酷的乐观——承认黑暗，但拒绝被黑暗吞噬。\n该死的从来不是努力生存的人，而是制造这种生存困境的系统。我们的任务不是去死，而是看着它先死。\n要活着，要清醒地活着，要带着尊严活着。活得足够久，久到能亲眼看见这套吃人逻辑的崩塌。\n要活得比这个腐朽的系统更长久。要在他们的废墟上跳舞，要在历史的灰烬中找到那些和我们一样拒绝被异化的灵魂。\n不要用自我苛责来合理化不公，该死的从来不是努力生存的普通人，而是那些制造苦难却逍遥法外的规则制定者。 把愤怒转化为清晰的认知和行动——该消失的是腐朽的规则，而不是被规则压垮的人。 剥削系统依赖大多数人的自我怀疑和恐惧运转。当你拒绝成为“人上人”游戏的参与者时，就已经在削弱它的控制力。真正的反抗未必是激烈的冲突，而是安静地退出游戏，并让更多人看清游戏的荒诞。 历史周期律残酷但公平：所有压榨普通人的系统，最终都会因贪婪反噬自身。我们要做的，是保持健康、清醒和移动能力，活到看他们先崩溃的那一天。 世界不该如此，但我们能决定自己如何存在。 该死的从来不是认真生活的人，而是那些把世界变成地狱还指责他人不够忍耐的既得利益者。我们活着，他们才该害怕。 具体生存方法论 既然拒绝成为系统的牺牲品，那就必须制定切实可行的生存策略。\n心理防御：建立精神防火墙 目标：避免被社会焦虑、集体癫狂和内耗吞噬。\n具体方法： ✅ 信息断舍离\n减少无意义的信息摄入（如短视频、热搜、焦虑贩卖类内容）。 定期“数字排毒”，比如每周一天不碰社交媒体。 ✅ 认知重构\n每当自我怀疑时，问自己：“这是事实，还是别人灌输给我的恐惧？” 建立自己的价值评判体系，不依赖外界认可。 ✅ 情绪管理\n练习正念冥想，减少情绪内耗。 允许自己愤怒，但避免让愤怒变成自我攻击。 经济策略：降低系统依赖性 目标：减少被资本收割的可能，提高抗风险能力。\n具体方法： ✅ 极简消费\n区分“需要\u0026quot;和“想要”，减少非必要支出。 不盲目追求品牌、身份象征类消费。 ✅ 财务避险\n不负债：避免房贷、车贷、消费贷等长期债务。 现金为王：保持至少 6 个月的生活费储备。 不盲目投资：拒绝股市、币圈等高风险赌博式理财。 职业选择：逃离“白领绞肉机” 目标：避免成为可替代的螺丝钉，寻找更可持续的生存方式。\n具体方法： ✅ 保持随时离开的能力\n定期更新简历。 学习新技能，避免被单一职业绑定。 社交策略：建立真实共同体 目标：摆脱虚假社交，找到真正可互助的盟友。\n具体方法： ✅ 远离消耗型关系\n减少与“精神太监”（只会抱怨但不敢改变的人）的互动。 警惕“正能量暴君”（强迫你乐观的人）。 ✅ 减少无效社交\n不讨好无关紧要的人。 身体与精神健康：活到看他们先死的那天 目标：保持身心健康，避免被系统拖垮。\n具体方法： ✅ 体能储备\n规律运动（跑步、游泳、力量训练）。 学习基础医疗知识（如急救、自然疗法）。 ✅ 精神韧性\n每天留出“自我时间”（阅读、写作、艺术创作）。 培养“无用之用”的爱好（如种菜、徒步）。 ✅ 睡眠与饮食\n保证 7-8 小时睡眠，避免熬夜透支。 减少外卖，学习简单烹饪，降低生活成本。 终极策略：保持迁徙自由 目标：不被单一地点、职业或身份绑架，随时能换赛道。\n具体方法： ✅ 物理迁徙\n研究低成本宜居地（如东南亚、南欧、小城市）。 办理能增加流动性的证件（如护照、签证、技能证书）。 ✅ 精神迁徙\n学习新语言，打开信息茧房。 保持“局外人”心态，不把任何系统当作归宿。 我的生存法则 心理上：清醒认知，拒绝被规训。 经济上：降低负债，现金为王。 职业上：选择抗衰退赛道，保持离开能力。 社交上：远离消耗者，结盟真实伙伴。 健康上：体能储备，精神韧性。 终极自由：保持迁徙能力，不绑定任何系统。

Marketing Strategy Creating Value for Target Customers Learning Objectives\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\n✅ Define the major steps in designing a customer-driven marketing strategy:\n✨ segmentation, targeting, differentiation and positioning\n✅ List and discuss the major bases for segmenting the customer\n✅ Explain how companies identify market segments and choose a market targeting strategy\nLecture Overview Market Segmentation (S) Market Target (T) Differentiation and Positioning (P) Communicating and Delivering the Chosen Position Market Segmentation (S) Major Segmentation Variables Market segmentation is the process that companies use to divide large heterogeneous markets into small markets that can be reached more efficiently and effectively with products and services that match their unique needs.\nThere is no single way to segment a market A market has to try different segmentation variables, alone and in combination, to find the best way to view the market structure Here we look at the major geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral variables Geographic Segmentation Dividing the market into different geographic units such as nations, regions, states, counties, etc Many companies localize their products, advertising, promotion, and sales efforts to fit the needs of individual regions and cities Demographic Segmentation Demographic segmentation divides the market into groups based on variables such as age, gender, family size, family life cycle, income, occupation, education, religion, race, generation, and nationality. It is the most popular segmentation method because consumer needs, wants, and usage often vary closely with demographic variables and are easier to measure than other types of variables.\nAge and life-cycle stage segmentation is the process of offering different products or using different marketing approaches for different age and life-cycle groups Gender segmentation divides the market based on sex (male or female) Income segmentation divides the market into different income groups Psychographic Segmentation most powerful Divides buyers into different groups based on social class, lifestyle, or personality characteristics By studying the activities, interests, and opinions (AIOs) E.g. What kind of hobbies do you have? (activities) What is important to you (interests)? How do you see the world (opinions)? Behavioral Segmentation Behavioral segmentation divides buyers into groups based on their knowledge, attitudes, uses, or responses to a product.\nOccasion Benefits sought User status Usage rate Loyalty status Occasion segmentation divides buyers into groups according to occasions when they get the idea to buy, actually make purchases, or respond to a product.\nBenefit segmentation requires finding the major benefits people look for in the product class, the kinds of people who look for each benefit, and the major brands that deliver each benefit.\nUser status divides buyers into ex-users, potential users, first- time users, and regular users of a product.\nUsage rate divides buyers into light, medium, and heavy product users.\nLoyalty status divides buyers into groups according to their degree of loyalty.\nRequirements for Effective Segmentation To be useful, a market segment must be:\nMeasurable The size, purchasing power, and profiles of the segments can be measured Accessibe The market segments can be effectively reached and served Substantial The market segments are large or profitable enough Differentiable The segments respond differently to different marketing mix elements and programs Actionable Effective programs can be designed for attracting and serving the segments Marketing Target (T) Segmentation reveals the opportunities in different market segments. A firm must evaluate various segments to decide how many and which segments it can serve best. Target market consists of a set of buyers who share common needs or characteristics in a segment (s) that company decides to serve. A firm should consider:\nSegment size and growth Segment structural attractiveness Company objectives and resources Evaluating Market Segments Segment size and growth:\nSmaller versus larger segments Growth potential Segment structural attractiveness:\nLevel of competition Substitute products Power of buyers Power of suppliers Company objectives and resources:\nCompetitive advantage Availability of resources Consistent with company objectives Selecting Target Market Segments undifferentiated marketing Differentiated marketing Concentrated marketing Micromarketing Undifferentiated marketing (mass-marketing) ignores market segment differences and targets the whole market with one offer.\nFocuses on common needs rather than what\u0026rsquo;s different Modern markets have strong doubts about this strategy Differentiated marketing (segmented marketing) targets several different market segments and designs separate offers for each.\nGoal is to achieve higher sales and stronger position More expensive than undifferentiated marketing Concentrated marketing (niche marketing) targets a large share of one or a few segments of niches\nLimited company resources Better knowledge of the market More effective and efficient Micromarketing is the practice of tailoring products and marketing programs to suit the needs and wants of specific individuals and local customer groups.\nIndividual marketing tailors products and marketing programs to the needs of individual customers. Also known as mass customization, one-to-one marketing.\nDifferentiation and Positioning (P) Value proposition Information overloaded → marketers must choose a value proposition. How a company will create differentiated value for targeted segments and what positions it wants to occupy in those segments. Product position is the way the product is defined by consumers on important attributes. Choosing a Differentiation and Positioning Strategy\nIdentifying a set of possible competitive advantages to build a position Choosing the right competitive advantages Selecting an overall positioning strategy Identigying Competitive Advantages to Build a Position Competitive advantage is the advantage over competitors gained by offering greater value either through lower prices or by providing more benefits that justify higher prices.\nTo the extent that a company can differentiate and position itself as providing superior customer value, it gains competitive advantage.\nIdentifying a set of possible competitive advantages to build a position by providing superior value from:\nProduct differentiation Service differentiation Channels (distribution) People Image Choosing the Right Competitive Advantages A company should develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for each brand and stick to it.\nSome marketers think that companies should position themselves on more than one differentiator.\nHow many differences to promote? Why? Which difference to promote? Not all brand differences are meaningful or worthwhile; Not every difference makes a good differentiator Which Differences to Promote —— Important Criteria:\nImportant: The difference delivers a highly valued benefit to target buyers. Distinctive: Competitors do not offer the difference, or the company can offer it in a more distinctive way. Superior: The difference is superior to other ways that customers might obtain the same benefit. Communicable: The difference is communicable and visible to buyers. Preemptive: Competitors cannot easily copy the difference. Affordable: Buyers can afford to pay for the difference. Profitable: The company can introduce the difference profitably. Developing a Positioning Statement Positioning statement is a statement that summarizes company or brand positioning\nFormat: To (target segment and need) our (brand) is (concept) that (point of difference).\nExamples of Positioning Statement \"To busy, mobile people who need to always be in the loop, the iPad is a multi-touch screen wireless connectivity solution that provides the best way to experience the Web, email, photos, and videos with just the touch of a finger.\" Lecture Review Product Strategy The Marketing Process Lecture Overview What is a Product? Product Decisions Branding Strategy: Building Strong Brands What is a Product? A product is anything that can be offered in a market for attention, acquisition, use, or consumption that might satisfy a need or want.\nBroadly defined, \u0026ldquo;products\u0026rdquo; also include services, events, persons, places, organizations, ideas, or mixes of these.\nServices are a form of product that consists of activities, benefits, or satisfactions offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in ownership.\nE.g., Doctor\u0026rsquo;s exam, legal advice, entertainment, haircut, concert A company should consider four special service characteristics when designing marketing programs. How Services Differ form Goods Service Characteristics Characteristics Description Marketing Challenges Marketing Actions Intangibility Services that cannot be touched, seen, tasted, heard or felt in the same manner as goods. Difficulty in product evaluation Offer tangible token of service; Develop a brand Inseparability A characteristic of services that allows them to be produced and consumed simultaneously. Customers must be present; Customers must participate Make locations and times convenient; Make participation fun/beneficial Heterogeneity A characteristic of services that makes them less standardised and uniform than goods. Hard to maintain the service quality Training and standardization Perishability A characteristic of services that prevents them from being stored, warehoused or inventoried. Unused capacity is \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo;; High demand cannot be met Match demand and supply A company\u0026rsquo;s market offering often includes both tangible goods and intangible services.\nAt one extreme, the offer may consist of a pure tangible good, such as soap or toothpaste. At the other extreme are pure services.\nProducts, Services, and Experiences\nTo differentiate their offers, marketers are creating and managing customer experiences with their brands or company.\nProduct and Service Classifications Consumer products are products and services for personal consumption. Classified by how consumers buy them and thus how to market them. Convenience products are consumer products and services that the customer usually buys frequently, immediately, and with a minimum comparison and buying effort.\nE.g. newspapers, candy, fast food Shopping products are less frequently purchased consumer products and services that customers compare carefully on suitability, quality, price, and style in the process of selection and purchase.\nSpecialty products are consumer products and services with unique characteristics or brand identification for which a significant group of buyers is willing to make a special purchase effort.\nE.g. designer brands, luxury goods Unsought products are consumer products that the consumer does not know about or knows about but does not normally think of buying.\nE.g. life insurance, funeral services, blood donations Three Levels of Products Actual Product:\nActual product, features, design, packaging, quality level, brand name developed to deliver the core benefit. Core Custoemr Value:\nWhat is the buyer really buying? What is the core, problem-solving benefits and value consumers seek. Augmented Product:\nAdditional customer services and benefits around the core benefit and actual product to create the most satisfying customer experience. Three Levels of Products - Hotel\nActual Product To deliver the core benefit through Core Customer Value What is the buyer really buying? Augmented Product To create the most satisfying customer experience through Product and Service Decisions Individual product decisions Developing a product or service involves defining the benefits that it will offer. These benefits are communicated and delivered by product attributes such as\nQualtiy Features Style and design Quality is the characteristics of a product or service that can satisfy stated or implied customer needs\nProduct features are a competitive tool for differentiating a product from competitors\u0026rsquo; products. It should be assessed based on the value to the customer versus the cost to the company\nProduct style and design add value to customer value.\nBrand is the name, term, sign, or design, or a combination of these, that identifies the maker or seller of a product or service\nPackaging involves designing and producing the container or wrapper for a product. It helps to attract consumer attention, enhance usage experience and drive sale.\nConsumers face with numerous product choices. Attractive packaging helps to stand out from competition A good packaging can give a company an advantage over competitors and boost sales. When Heinz inverted the good old ketchup bottle, sales grew at three times more than competitor Packaging involves two functions\nPrimary Function hold and protect the product Good packaging create instant consumer recognition Lable can be simple tags or complex graphics to\nidentify the product or brand describe attributes provide promotion Product support services augment actual products. Companies must continually:\nAssess the value of current services to obtain ideas for new ones Develop a package of services to satisfy customers and provide profit to the company Product line decisions Product Line is a group of products that are closely related because they may:\nfunction in a similar manner be sold to similar customer groups be marketed through the same types of outlets fall within given price ranges A. Product Line Stretching\nlengthens the product line beyond its current range 3 types: upward, downward or combination of both B. Product Line Filling\nProduct Line Filling occurs when companies add more items within the present range of the line Excess line filling will result in cannibalization and customer confusion Reasons More profits Satisfying dealers Excess capacity Being the leading full-line company Plugging holes to fend off competitors Product mix decisions Product mix (or product portfolio) consists of all the products and items that a particular seller offers for sale. A company\u0026rsquo;s product mix has four dimensions: width, length, depth, and consistency.\nProduct mix width ➔ the number of different product lines Product mix length ➔ the total number of items within a product line Product mix depth ➔ the number of versions offered of each product in the line Product mix consistency refers to how closely related the various product lines are in end use, production requirements, distribution channels, or some other way A company can increase its business in four ways in terms of its product mix:\nIt can add new product lines, widening its product mix. It can lengthen its existing product lines. It can add more versions of each product, deepening its product mix. It can pursue more product line consistency. Branding Strategy: Building Strong Brands Brand represents the consumer\u0026rsquo;s perceptions and feelings about a product and its performance.\nBrand equity is the positive differential effect that knowing the brand name has on customer response to the product or service.\nBrand Development A company has four choices when it comes to developing brands Line Extensions Line extensions occur when a company extends existing brand names to new forms, colors, sizes, ingredients, or flavors of an existing product category.\nAdvantages\nLow-cost, low-risk to introduce new products Meet consumer desires for variety Use excess capacity Occupy more shelf-space form resellers Disadvantages\nConfusion and frustration Cannibalization Brand Extensions Brand extensions extend a brand name to a new or modified product in a new category.\nAdvantages\nInstant recognition and faster acceptance Save the high advertising costs Disadvantages\nConfuse the image of the main brand Harm consumer attitudes toward the other products carrying the same brand name May not be appropriate to a particular new product Multibrands Multibrands are additional brands in the same category\nAdvantages\nEstablish different features and appeal to different buying motives Occupy more shelf-space Disadvantages\nSpending its resources over many brands which each brand only obtains a small market share and none may be very profitable Managing different brand is difficult New Brands New brands are used when existing brands are inappropriate for new products in new product categories or markets.\nLecture Review

我突然发现，我是一个非常有韧劲的人，绝对不会让自己一直抑郁的人。\n是怎么发现的呢？没错，我又是在考后懊恼后顿悟的。我重来没有进行过一场完美的考试：有些知识点怎么偏偏要到考试时才会发现没有复习呢？有些答案怎么就是在考试的时候想不出来呢？有些错误怎么就是考场上才会犯呢？每次考完我都会这么想，我会觉得分数对不起我的努力。我从来不觉得努力廉价，但怅然于努力换不来应有的价值。接着，我会期待分数晚一点出来，这样我会像鸵鸟一样多把头多埋在沙子里一会；然后，在查到分数后伤心一阵子；最后，把这件事情忘记，就好像这场试没有考过，继续接下来的生活。上面的这些构成了我每一次考完试的流程。\n很喜欢一句话\n当你抑郁时，你是在活在过去；\n当你平静时，你是在活在当下；\n当你焦虑时，你是在活在未来。\n我会有抑郁情绪，更多的是由懊恼和后悔带来；在事情当下的发生那刻，我会想：我真的好想死呀！但冷静之后，我就会去规划下一步该怎么做，下一步应该怎么办。再大的事情睡一觉之后就一点都想不起来，太阳照常升起，仍然是崭新的一天。但当一想到已经发生的事，仍会有抑郁情绪向我袭来。我的大脑就像开启了自动保护机制，如果我不主动去想这件事就不会困扰着我，有点像鸵鸟心理，可是这样我才能甩甩袖子拂去灰尘继续前行。\n除去生死，一切都是小事。\n我常常会为那些自杀的人感到惋惜。我明白我无法和自杀的人感同身受也没有资格为她们感到不值。感到惋惜不是因为辜负了爱她们的母父，不是因为觉得她们放弃了大好的年华这样惯常的原因，而是她们辜负了那个曾经千千万万次救自己于水火的那个曾经的自我。\n","date":"2025-04-11T21:58:20+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%9B%9B%E6%9C%88-%E9%9D%92%E6%A1%88%E7%84%A6%E5%BF%83%E5%90%AC%E6%99%9A%E8%8E%BA/title_hu_a04201514dc48d78.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%9B%9B%E6%9C%88-%E9%9D%92%E6%A1%88%E7%84%A6%E5%BF%83%E5%90%AC%E6%99%9A%E8%8E%BA/","title":"四月

2025年3月24日，我走进了理发店，这一次我没有选择自己理发（手艺实在不精，也或是天气的燥热让我不能再忍受更久了），距离上次我自己理发已经过去了整整两个月了，最长的头发已经有足足3cm了。出门晚了，我让理发师剃了熟悉的9mm，仅仅用了15min，就完成了这次剃头。\n数数日子，距离我想剃寸头已经三年了，距离我剃了寸头过去了两年。我有些后悔自己没有早点开始，后悔自己曾经浪费了太多时间。\n我不止一次感叹，我喜欢我的身体，我越来越喜欢我的身体。\n更重要的是，我全然收回了自己的知觉能力。每一刻，都可以是对外在环境的感受和对内心各种丰富情绪的敏锐觉察和捕捉。而不是把所有注意力都放在时刻担心自己的外表是否得体和举止是否优雅上。我可以享受风吹过头皮的瞬间，享受毛孔的自在呼吸。\n我命令风穿过发间的荒原\n让每一寸头皮在呼啸中苏醒\n不是风在抚摸我\n是我在驯服风的形状——\n它跪伏成梳齿\n我昂起头颅\n整片天空便成了我的冠冕\n我突然间明白，原来男性一直处在一个如此便利的生活中。\n可是，到底是谁规定了这样的审美?是谁规定了通过头发长短，衣着的修身程度来区分女性和男性?为什么男性能够将这样一种如此便利的生活方式以文化的形式占为已有?为什么辛亥革命只有男性剪掉了辫子，因为他们知道辫子的累赘。\n简单的、习以为常的表象之后是权力关系的博弈。当女性以为自己生来便喜欢长发、化妆、超短裙、白幼瘦时，这种“喜欢”的背后又是由什么权力关系塑造?这些问题我很喜欢反复询问自己，心中也早有答案。\n从那以后，我不再为美丽工业投掷金钱，没有了各式各样化妆品，我省下大笔钱投入到自己喜欢的事情，和自我规划发展中。\n人一旦体验过舒适的生活方式，就不会再回到从前的不舒适中。\n就像剪寸头，尝试过后便只有一次和无数次。\n","date":"2025-03-31T02:25:34+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%A4%B4%E7%9A%AE%E6%97%A5%E8%AE%B0-%E4%B8%8E%E9%A3%8E%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E7%9A%84365%E5%A4%A9/title_hu_8a1eec68609d21bb.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%A4%B4%E7%9A%AE%E6%97%A5%E8%AE%B0-%E4%B8%8E%E9%A3%8E%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E7%9A%84365%E5%A4%A9/","title":"头皮日记

Pharmacies in China are an integral part of the healthcare system, tasked with dispensing medications in accordance with strict regulatory standards. While their physical appearance may resemble that of other retail stores, pharmacies operate under specific laws that differentiate them. Many medications, particularly prescription drugs, cannot be sold without a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Even with a prescription, there are often limits on the quantity of drugs a customer can purchase. These regulations are designed to ensure the safe and responsible distribution of medications.\nIn addition to prescription verification, pharmacists in China are required to perform thorough background checks on customers, including reviewing their medical history. This helps ensure that patients are not involved in drug abuse and prevents harmful drug interactions. As a result, pharmacy management systems play a crucial role in ensuring compliance with these regulations. These systems facilitate the tracking of prescriptions, managing medication limits, and maintaining accurate customer records, all of which contribute to patient safety and efficient pharmacy operations.\nWith this project, our aim is to develop a comprehensive system that could deal with challenges faced in day to day operation of a modern pharmacy.\nEntities Coutomer When a customer arrives in the pharmacy, we identify them based on their PIN (Personal Identification Number). If they are a new customer, they are asked for their name, date of birth, phone number, gender and address.\nInsurance In China, as of 2023, the basic medical insurance coverage rate remains stable at over 95% (National Healthcare Security Administration data). The wide - spread coverage is mainly due to the continuous improvement and popularization of the national basic medical insurance system, which includes the urban employee basic medical insurance, the urban and rural residents\u0026rsquo; basic medical insurance. The high coverage is crucial because medical expenses can be relatively large for some serious diseases and treatments. Without insurance, many people may face financial difficulties in affording necessary medical services.\nIf a customer has health insurance, we store the insurance ID (unique for each customer), start date, end date and Co-Insurance. Co-Insurance is a percentage amount that insurance company pays for a medicinal purchase. Given the customer PIN and insurance ID, the system should be able to automatically calculate the amount paid by medical insurance fund and customer.\nEmployees An employee has same details as a customer but they are also given a company ID, that is unique for them. An employee has to have one of the following roles:\nPharmacist CPhT (Certified Pharmacy Technician) Intern (can work in the pharmacy part time) Cashier Apart from pharmacy cashiers, all personnel directly involved in drug dispensing and preparation are required to obtain professional qualification certificates issued by the National Medical Products Administration.\nPrescription Most of the drugs in the pharmacy can only be sold with a prescription. A prescription contains customer’s PIN, the prescribing Doctor’s ID (required by law) and when the prescription was prescribed. Each prescription contains a number of prescribed drugs with drug name, quantity and refill limit of each of them.\nPrescription Drug Prescription drugs can only be dispensed with a valid doctor\u0026rsquo;s prescription. They\u0026rsquo;re more potent and regulated strictly. Prescription Drug is represented in the system with a unique identifier, PresplD. This helps in precisely tracking each individual prescription - related drug record. The DrugName clearly states the name of the medication, which can be either the generic or brand name. PrespQty indicates the quantity of the drug that has been prescribed for the customer. This is an important detail as it affects how much of the drug is dispensed. RefillLimit defines the number of times the customer can get a refill for this particular drug based on the original prescription.\nOrder An order is created from the prescription. This data has to be stored separately because customer may:\nBuy less medicine than prescription specifies Come back for refills based on same prescription Each order has a unique Order ID that is automatically assigned by the system. Each order can have multiple drugs, each with their ordered quantity and price. We also record batch number of the drug.\nOrdered Drugs Ordered drugs are selected by customers per prescription or OTC needs. The system records drug name, quantity (which may differ from prescription), price, and links them to a unique Order ID. For prescription - based orders, it cross - references prescription details for compliance.\nBill Once an order has been completed, a bill is generated by the system. This bill is handed over to the customer and contains order information, insurance information as well as breakdown of amount paid. The breakdown should be automatically calculated by the system based on insurance, customer and medicine data.\nMedicine (Inventory) Drugs are divided into \u0026ldquo;over-the-counter drugs\u0026rdquo; (OTC drugs), \u0026ldquo;prescription drugs\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;controlled drugs\u0026rdquo;. For all types of drugs, especially prescription drugs and controlled drugs, pharmaceutical institutions and medical facilities are legally obligated to maintain accurate and up-to-date inventory records. This is not only for the purpose of record - keeping but also to effectively manage stock levels. Timely inventory management helps to ensure the continuous availability of necessary drugs while also preventing overstocking or shortages. OTC drugs, on the other hand, are more accessible to the public but still need to be sold and inventoried in accordance with relevant regulations to guarantee their quality and proper supply.\nDisposal Drugs are marked for disposal when expired, damaged, or in case of controlled drugs following medical regulations. Once disposed, inventory records are updated. The system then generates a disposal record, which includes the drug name, the batch number of the drug, the name of the company that produced the drug, and the dispensed quantity.\nNotifications The system should be able to generate notifications based on the following four events:\nStock for a medicine is low (less than 100 tablets) Some medicine will expire in next 60 days Drugs are marked for disposal Drugs are successfully disposed The notifications are sent to all the employees who are Pharmacists.\nER Modeling ER Diagram Logical Data Model Diagram ","date":"2025-03-20T21:25:06+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E8%8D%AF%E6%88%BF%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/pharmacy_hu_9232b17c80a5c985.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E8%8D%AF%E6%88%BF%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/","title":"药房数据库管理系统"},{"content":"Physical Database Design Intro to physical database design Database Building (Physical Design)\nBuild the database and write application programs Purpose\ntranslate the logical description of data into the technical specifications for storing and retrieving data using a specific DBMS Goal\ncreate a design for storing data that will provide adequate performance and ensure database integrity, security, and recoverability MySQL database structure A MySQL database consists of multiple user accounts A user account can contain different databases Also called database schemas Physical design process Field, data type, and index Dsigning fields What is field?\nsmallest unit of application data recognized by system software Field design considerations\nChoosing data type Coding, compression, encryption Controlling data integrity Naming rules for tables and fields 1 to 64 characters long\nCan contain letters, numbers, or underscores\nCan’t contain certain symbols and keywords\nEvery table in your database must have a unique name\nEvery field in a table must have a unique name\nCase sensitivity (in MySQL):\nKeywords: No Table and Columns/Fields name: No (exception: Linux) Purpose\nSpecify internal encoding Optimize internal storage use Provide error checking mechanisms Datatypes in different database may be slightly different\nMain data types in MySQL Text data types\nCHAR VARCHAR Number data types\nIntegers: INT and variations Floating point numbers: DECIMAL, FLOAT Dates \u0026amp; times\nDATE, TIME, and variations Character: Use an appropriate character data type for all fields that are not numbers or dates\nNames, addresses, etc. Postal codes, telephone numbers, social security numbers Numeric\nSurrogate keys 代理键 (primary key ID values) All numeric data you might use in a calculation (prices, quantities, etc.) CHAR data type\nFor fixed-width character fields (1 – 255 characters) Fields in which you know the exact number of characters Pads out the remaining characters with blank spaces Removes the trailing blank spaces when data is retrieved VARCHAR data type\nFor variable-width character fields (1-255 characters) Number of characters varies for individual data values Values are not padded with blank spaces CHAR or VARCHAR?\nUse CHAR when the sizes of the column data entries are consistent Use VARCHAR when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably Use VARCHAR(MAX) when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably, and the string length might exceed 8,000 bytes Q\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; But if VARCHAR is so efficient in handling the space management dynamically based on the content being stored, why databases has the support for CHAR datatype, all CHAR(n) fields can be VARCHAR(n) fields, right ? \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A CHAR fields require less string manipulation because of fixed field widths, index lookups against CHAR field are on average 20% faster than that of VARCHAR fields.

For example, we want to find out the offering that a professor teaches? Data sources are fragmented To get a comprehensive view of a scenario Uncover interesting patterns Combine information from two tables Form pairs of related rows from two tables where the matching columns (recall: FK) in each of the two tables have the same value To perform a join Simply list more than one table name in the FROM clause, using a comma as a separator, and FROM offering, faculty Typically use a WHERE clause to specify the join conditions WHERE offering.FacSSN = faculty.FacSSN Alias An alias can be used for a table named in the FROM clause, where the alias is separated from the table name with a space e.g., FROM offering O, faculty F Can two different tables have the same alisa? When can an alias be used? Used to qualify a column name whenever there is ambiguity regarding the source of the column name e.g., WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN Also used as a shorthand notation for the table name An alias can be used anywhere in place of the table name Example Example: Two-table joining\nQ1: list the OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName for fall 2002 IS courses taught by assistant professors, and order results by FacLastName (ASC) and CourseNo (DESC)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM offering O, faculty F WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN AND FacRank = \u0026#39;ASST\u0026#39; AND CourseNo LIKE \u0026#39;IS%\u0026#39; AND OffTerm = \u0026#39;FALL\u0026#39; AND OffYear = 2002 ORDER BY FacLastName, CourseNo DESC; Example: Three-table joining\nQ2: List Leonard Vince’s teaching schedule in fall 2002. For each course, list the offering number, course number, number of units, days, location, and time.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 SELECT OfferNo, O.CourseNo, CrsUnits, OffDays, OffLocation, OffTime FROM faculty F, course C, offering O WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN AND O.CourseNo = C.CourseNo AND OffYear = 2002 AND OffTerm = \u0026#39;FALL\u0026#39; AND FacFirstName = \u0026#39;Leonard\u0026#39; AND FacLastName = \u0026#39;Vince\u0026#39; Summarization in multiple tables\nPowerful combination List join conditions in the WHERE clause Q3: List the number of students enrolled for each 2003 offering.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT offering.OfferNo, COUNT(*) AS NumStudents FROM enrollment E, offering O WHERE E.OfferNo = O.OfferNo AND OfferYear = 2003 GROUP BY O.OfferNo Different types of JOIN Inner Join and Outer Join List all the offerings and the information about their instructors 1 2 3 SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM offering O, faculty F WHERE F.FacSSN = O.FacSSN We have 13 offerings in Offering tables but only see 11 offerings in the result. Why? New demand for Join We need another operator for the item that have a match, it behaves like a Join but for the items that have NO MATCH, it appends the record with NULLs The operators with these properties are called outer joins. (There are several of them) The operators that we studied already are also called inner joins (To distinguish them from outer joins) (Inner/Natural) Join excludes non matching rows Preserving non matching rows is important in some problems Outer join variations Full outer join 全外连接 One-sided outer join 单边外连接 JOIN and INNER JOIN Use INNER/FULL/LEFT/RIGHT JOIN and ON keywords in the FROM clause INNER JOIN = JOIN Mixing Inner and Outer Join Combine columns from the Faculty, Offering, and Course tables for IS Courses (list OfferNo, CourseNo, OffTerm, CrsDesc, FacSSN, FacLastName). Including a row in the result even if there is not an assigned instructor.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT OfferNo, offering.CourseNo, OffTerm, CrsDesc, faculty.FacSSN, FacLastName FROM ( faculty RIGHT JOIN offering ON offering.FacSSN = faculty.FacSSN) INNER JOIN course ON course.courseNo = offering.courseNo WHERE course.CourseNo LIKE \u0026#39;IS%\u0026#39; Structured Query Language Part 3 How to write nested queries Type 1 nested queries Retrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students.\nQuery inside q query Use in WHERE and HAVING conditions Executes one time No reference to outer query Also known as non-correlated or independent nested query 1 2 3 4 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE FacSSN NOT IN (SELECT StdSSN FROM student ); Type 2 nested queries Similar to nested loops Executes one time for each row of outer query Reference to outer query Also known as correlated or variably nested query Retrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students.\n1 2 3 4 5 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM student WHERE student.StdSSN = faculty.FacSSN ); Type 2 nested query animation Alternative Outer Join with Only Nonmatching Rows\nRetrieve the social security number, the name (first and last), the department, and the salary of faculty who are not students. 1 2 3 4 5 SELECT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty LEFT JOIN student ON faculty.FacSSN = student.StdSSN WHERE student.StdSSN IS NULL; Can we use Inner Join?\n1 2 3 SELECT DISTINCT FacSSN, FacFirstName, FacLastName, FacDept, FacSalary FROM faculty, student WHERE student.StdSSN \u0026lt;\u0026gt; faculty.FacSSN; Difference problems cannot be solved with inequality joins there is at least one student row that does not match every faculty row.\nOther use cases List the first name of faculty who has the highest salary.\n1 2 SELECT FacFirstName, MAX(FacSalary) FROM faculty 1 2 3 SELECT FacFirstName, FacSalary FROM faculty WHERE FacSalary = (SELECT MAX(FacSalary) FROM faculty) We want to know the total amount of faculty’s highest salary for each department.\n1 2 3 4 SELECT SUM(MaxSalary) FROM(SELECT FacDept, Max(FacSalary) AS MaxSalary FROM faculty GROUP BY FacDept) AS tmp1 Write and Edit Data Data manipulation language Query(read-only) SELECT: to query data in the database Update(write) INSERT: inserts new rows of data into a table UPDATE: modifies existing data in a table DELETE: deletes rows of data from a table Attention: SQL uses the reserved keyword UPDATE to mean \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo; specifically. However, the term \u0026ldquo;update\u0026rdquo; is also used to refer to the three operations Insert a Single Row Format of INSERT statement INSERT INTO TableName[(columnList)] VALUES (dataValueList) columnList A list of one or more column names separated by commas Optional If omitted, SQL assumes all columns in order If specified, any columns that are omitted from the list are assumed to have NULL values dataValueList must match columnList Have same number of items Have direct correspondence in the position of items in the two lists Data type must be compatible INSERT Example Insert a row into the Student table supplying values for all columns.\n1 2 3 4 5 INSERT INTO student (StdSSN, StdFirstName, StdLastName, StdCity, StdState, StdZip, StdClass, StdMajor, StdGPA) VALUES (\u0026#39;999999999\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;JOE\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;STUDENT\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;SEATAC\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;WA\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;98042-1121\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;FR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;IS\u0026#39;, 0.0) Web crawler + INSERT Scrapy - How to crawl website \u0026amp; store data in Microsoft SQL Server database?\n1 2 3 self.cursor.execute(\u0026#34;INSERT INTO MYTABLE(text, author, tags) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\u0026#34;, (item[\u0026#39;text\u0026#39;], item[\u0026#39;author\u0026#39;], item[\u0026#39;tags\u0026#39;])) UPDATE Statement Formate of UPDATE statement 1 2 3 UPDATE TableName SET columnName1 = dataValue1 [, columnName2 = dataValue2 …] [WHERE searchCondition]; Processing order: UPDATE→WHERE→SET SET clause: specifies the names of one or more columns that are to be updated WHEREclause is optional If omitted, all rows are updated for the named columns If specified, only those rows that satisfy the searchCondition are updated dataValue(s): must have compatible data type(s) for the corresponding column(s) UPDATE Example Change the major and class of Homer Wells.\n1 2 3 UPDATE student SET StdMajor = \u0026#39;ACCT\u0026#39;, StdClass = \u0026#39;SO\u0026#39; WHERE StdFirstName = \u0026#39;HOMER\u0026#39; AND StdLastName = \u0026#39;WELLS\u0026#39; DELETE Statement Format of DELETE statement 1 2 DELETE FROM TableName [WHERE searchCondition]; WHERE clause is optional If omitted, all rows are deleted from the table; however, this doesn’t delete the table itself (i.e., table’s column names are still there).

AND StdClass = \u0026#39;SR\u0026#39; Query Evaluation and Efficiency Tips for developing queries Be familiar with the data model (entities and relationships) Review ERD Understand the desired results Know the attributes desired in result Identify the entities that contain desired attributes Use LIMIT and TOP to get an overview of a table Fine tune with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses if needed Consider the effect on unusual data Query efficiency considerations Instead of SELECT *, identify the specific attributes in the SELECT clause; this helps reduce network traffic of result set Try to make everything done in a single query if possible Limit the number of subquery If data is to be used many times, make a separate query and store it as a view Guidelines for better query design Understand how indexes are used in query processing Keep optimizer statistics up-to-date Use compatible data types for fields and literals Break complex queries into multiple simple parts Create temporary tables for groups of queries Combine update operations Consider the total query processing time for ad hoc queries Structured Query Language Part 4 View SQL View is a virtual table that is constructed from other tables or views It has no data of its own, but obtains data from tables or other views It only has a definition Views can be used as regular tables in SELECT statements CREATE VIEW Command 1 2 3 CREATE VIEW faculty_name_view AS SELECT FacFirstName, FacLastName FROM faculty; To see the view use: 1 2 SELECT * FROM faculty_name_view Uses for SQL Views Display results of computations Hide complicated SQL syntax Provide a level of isolation between actual data and the user’s view of data three-tier architecture: database -\u0026gt; application -\u0026gt; client Security: hide columns and rows Assign different processing permissions to different views on same table Assign different triggers to different views on same table PostgreSQL and SQL Server allows it, but MySQL does not allow it Triggers and Routines Triggers- execute in response to a database event (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) Routines - Program modules that execute on demand Procedures routines that do not return values directly can be used in subsequent SQL statements take input or output parameters Functions routines that return values take input parameters Triggers vs. Routines Triggers Trigger: stored program that is executed by the DBMS whenever a specified event occurs Associated with a table Three basic trigger types: BEFORE, INSTEAD OF, and AFTER In DML trigger, each type can be declared for INSERT, UPDATE, and/or DELETE Resulting in a total of 9 trigger types Database triggers can be used to perform any of the following:\nAudit data modification Log events transparently Implement complex security authorizations Derive column values automatically Maintain replicate tables Create Trigger\n1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} {INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE} ON table_name FOR EACH ROW \u0026lt;triggered SQL statement here\u0026gt;;

Summary What is view and the advantage of using views How to write Trigger, Procedure, and Function NoSQL and MongoDB NoSQL Introduction What is NoSQL? Stands for \u0026ldquo;Not Only SQL\u0026rdquo; Non-relational data storage systems Supports unstructured format (no fixed schema) Well-suited for applications that deal with unstructured or semi structured data, such as social media, IoT devices, and e-commerce platforms Categories of NoSQL Document Store\nStores data using JSON, BSON documents Example: MongoDB, Couchbase Key-Value Data Store Stores data in unique key-value pairs Example: Dynamo, Redis Column Database Uses flat structure, but with keys stored in columns rather than rows Example: Cassandra, Hbase Graph Database Uses edges and nodes to represent and store data Example: Neo4j, JanusGraph RDBMS vs NoSQL How to pick?\nNature of data Row/column (structured) Unstructured, complex data which needs nesting Schema Static: RDBMS, Dynamic: NoSQL Flexibility of query RDBMS: Joins allow for flexibility NoSQL: Duplication of data, implement joins in middle - ware Data integrity RDBMS provide stronger consistency and integrity guarantees Handling “Big” data with better performance RDBMS normalization and joins are powerful, but add up in cost NoSQL databases are optimized for read and write operation MongoDB MongoDB is Created by 10gen (term derived from humongous) an open source, document-oriented database designed stores BSON (JSON-like) documents Schema-less MongoDB was founded in 2007 by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz and Kevin Ryan the team behind DoubleClick JSON JavaScript Object Notation\nPlain text file Organized as objects within braces { } Uses key-value pairs keys are field names; strings in quotes values are the data; strings, numbers, Boolean (quotes around strings required) a comma separates the key-value pairs 1 2 key: value \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C-3P0\u0026#34; Values can be any lenth MongoDB\nThe easiest way to get started with MongoDB is MongoDB Atlas. Atlas is MongoDB\u0026rsquo;s fully managed database-as-a-service. MongoDB has an Aggregation Framework. Aggregation Tab\nAggregation tap allows us to create pipeline stages, which specifies multiple stages of queries, to return a subset of documents from collection. Query in NoSQL NoSQL is new to us!\nLet’s make some comparisons between NoSQL operations and the SQL commands How to do SELECT, WHERE, SORT, GROUP BY in NoSQL? Return the Specified Fields $project $project: {name: 1, beds: 1, bedrooms: 1, price:1} The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement 1 SELECT name, bed_type, bedrooms FROM… The _id field is, by default, included in the output documents. You can remove by setting the field to 0.\nSpecify Equality Condition $match stage filters the documents to pass only the documents that match the specified condition(s) $match $match: {bedrooms: 3} $match corresponds to the following SQL statement: 1 SELECT… FROM … WHERE bedrooms = 3 Specify Conditions Using Operators Syntax: $match: { : { : }, ... } For example $match: { price: { $gt: 200 } } corresponds to the following SQL statement: 1 2 SELECT * FROM airbnb WHERE price \u0026gt; 200; Sore Results Using $sort stage, we can specify the sort order of the returned documents $sort: { price: 1 } The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement 1 SELECT * FROM airbnb ORDER By price ASC; We can set the field to 1 (-1), to specify ascending (descending) order for a field.\nAggregation $group documents by some specified expression and outputs to the next stage a document for each distinct grouping Syntax $group: {_id:\u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;field\u0026gt;:{\u0026lt;accumulator1\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;expression1\u0026gt;}, ...} group: {_id:\u0026quot;$beds\u0026quot;, avgprice: {$avg: \u0026quot;$price\u0026quot;}} corresponds to the following SQL statement 1 2 3 SELECT beds, avg(price) as airbnb FROM airbnb Group by beds; Summary What is NoSQL and when to use it How to write NoSQL queries Future Trends in Database Large Language Models and Database Questions\nHave you used AI tools to help with database design \u0026amp; SQL queries? How was your experience? Good or bad? LLM Sophisticated deep learning models that predicts what word comes next for any piece of text How LLMs learn Limitations of LLM\nHallucination: LLMs may confidently give wrong info Lack of real-time or proprietary knowledge Limited reasoning or symbolic logic Poor at tasks requiring up-to-date, precise, or secure data access Databases enhance LLM-RAG\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM + database = smart, grounded answers. Examples: Q\u0026amp;A Chatbot, Semantic search Main components (LangChain) Indexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline. Retrieval and generation: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. Using LLMs to Help Write SQL\nAsk a generic LLM apps to generate SQL queries without providing your db schema, you are unlikely to get correct queries It would be better if LLM apps know your database schema or can access your database Data Warehouse Challenges for modern organizations\nDrowning in data but starving for information Having the capability to collect and store data doesn’t mean using data wisely Fragmentation Data are from a variety of sources, including different hardware, software platforms, and applications Limited informational processing Most systems are developed to support operational processing, with little or no thought given to the information or analytical tools needed for decision making The need for data warehousing No single system of record Multiple systems are not synchronized A centralized repository can Integrates data from various systems/sources Synchronize data between systems Aggregate and clean data for analyses Data warehouse\nData warehouses consolidate and integrate information from many internal and external sources Arrange it in a meaningful format for making accurate and timely business decisions EIL in data warehouse Extract, transform, load (ETL) process for data warehousing Extract connecting to the data source, selecting the required data, and creating a copy of it Transform cleaning, filtering, and enriching the data to ensure that it is consistent and accurate Load creating tables, defining relationships, and inserting the data Advantages of data warehouse Improved data quality Data warehouses are designed to ensure data consistency and accuracy Better decision - making Provide decision - makers with easy access to large amounts of data Better performance Data warehouses are optimized for analytical queries, which improves query performance and enables faster data analysis Scalability Can handle large amounts of data, which enables them to scale as data volumes grow Data lake A data lake is a centralized repository that stores, processes, and secures large amounts of data in its native format, regardless of size Data lakes can accommodate all types of data, which is then used to power big

在冰岛，我坐在很大的邮轮上，波涛的海浪不停地翻腾，船颠簸地行驶着，感觉不到一丝寒冷，沉浸在海天一色中。\n我很喜欢刷手机，刷手机可以让我逃离现实无聊的世界，看到一个又一个有趣的帖子，犀利的发言，独到的观点，我会把这些放在收藏夹里，好似“收藏了就会了”，久而久之堆积成为“电子垃圾”。 在月记中，我专门记录一些我把刷手机的时间都放置在哪些具体的内容上了，也让这些时间不只为满足即刻的快感而浪费，发挥更大的价值。\n三月大事记 完成博客搭建 看了一场电影：《初步举证》 开始物品入库App: Find my stuff 整理全部物品件数 对生产的思考 To be a producer.\n成为一个生产者 让我对生产感到兴趣的是一句话。\n消费的快乐是比不上生产的快乐的。\n― （日）涩谷直人, 花小钱得自由 ——舍弃虚荣与钱包自在生活的50种方法 反消费主义 在我刚开始践行反消费主义时，我觉得不买无用的东西，只把钱花在要用的地方对我来说并不苦难。但是我感到非常拧巴，我得承认我觉得当我去消费购买一件物品时，这件物品是不是我需要的，消费这个过程是会让人感到快乐的，这是无法否认的。这句话似乎给了我答案，需要承认消费是带来快乐的，但快乐也可以通过生产产生，通过生产产生的快乐也将会是一种更意义的快乐。\n对女人来说,既然一样都要忍受,她们宁愿忍受生活单调无聊，也不愿忍受冒险之苦，她们比较容易从家里汲取微薄的幸福，而不容易从路上奔波赴险获得。对这样的女人，她们的命运维系在这些会变质腐败的东西上，一旦失去了这些东西，她们就等于失去了一切。只有自由的主体才能确立自我以超越时间，才能遏止变质腐败；但是女人是不准成为自由的主体的。但这主要是她从来没有体会到自由的力量，所以不相信自由解放；在她看来，这个世界是为幽昧不明的命运所支配,反抗命运是狂妄之举。走上追求自由的这几条危险道路,是别人强迫她去 做的,并不是她自己开辟出来的,也难怪她不会狂势地投入行动。\n― （法）西蒙·波伏娃, 第二性 女人可以藉着工作，大大拉近她和男人的距离；唯有工作能让她拥有具体的自由。她一旦不再寄生于男人，建立在她依附性上的整个系统就会坍塌；在她和这个世界之间，便不再需要男人做为中介。处于附庸地位的女人受到的诅咒是，她不许有任何作为，所以她才会殷殷切切地藉着自恋的表现,或藉着爱情、宗教追寻自我的存在而落得徒劳无功；但在她成为生产者、主动者之后，便能重新赢得自己的存在超越性；她以行动投入自己构思的人生时，便具体确立了自己是主体；她在承担了自己追求的目标、承担了属于自己的金钱和权利时，便体认到自己的责任。就算她从事的职业卑微，许多女人都很清楚自己会从工作中得到好处。\n― （法）西蒙·波伏娃, 第二性 但在她成为生产者、主动者之后，便能重新赢得自己的存在超越性。\n波伏娃在《第二性》中也提到了，赢得存在超越性的前提是成为生产者。\n杂谈 向前看 女性主义者真的是在霸凌和牺牲普通女性吗？ 不纠结于无意义的问题\n在文明社会里，面子是很重要的，比起真的吃亏，大部分人更不愿意被人看到自己吃亏。更有甚者，宁可吃了亏充面子，也不愿意不吃亏但被人觉得丢脸。所以你指出来她们吃了亏，那对她们来说就是十恶不赦。为什么男人反而不在乎呢，因为你指出男人是得利者，并没有伤害男人的面子，只有想结婚但结不了婚的男人会因为潜在利益受损而不高兴。别说是素昧平生的网友，就算是现实生活中的亲人朋友，你掏心掏肺劝人家结婚是赔本生意，人家也是要跟你翻脸的。\n那些骂“女权迫害女人”的娇妻，本质是被父权驯化的家禽啄食同类——自己吃着泔水还要骂野狼撕咬铁笼！她们把婚姻当子宫贷，还妄想用三从四德绑架全体女性当人质？真分裂女性的明明是婚恋市场的ABCD打分表，是牌坊精们把子宫当投名状的内卷！她们骂街时，骂的是提灯笼的人，还是不敢承认天早就亮了？省省吧，牌坊精，裹脚布臭到2025年了！\n谈觉醒 就我个人的体验来说其实觉醒了真的很快乐 在呼唤“女性觉醒”的时代，只要你感觉是快乐的，不觉醒也没关系。\n反驳\n往斜坡上丢一个小球，它也会自动地滚落，而且它最终一定会自愿地滚到坡底，哪怕它不自愿，斜坡也会帮它资源，这个斜坡就是社会结构，而你就是那个资源下滑的小球。\n如果一句话不能对一个国家说，那也不能对一个女人说：\n百年前，中国人说自己想屹立于世界民族之林会被嘲笑。百年后，中国人说自己想变成东亚病夫还是会被嘲笑。听自己的声音，别听流行。\n在呼喊外争国权内惩国贼的年代，只要你感觉你是快乐的，割地赔款也没关系。\n觉醒 ≠ 痛苦\n觉醒的阵痛是因为你剜掉了那块一直被纱布保护着但却腐臭的烂肉。做手术的过程当然很痛，但伤口会重新愈合，就可以重新走路了，就再也不需要那块“破纱布”了。\n任何鼓励“快乐堕落”的话术，都不叫自由，而是矫饰的陷阱。\n","date":"2025-03-13T21:43:49+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E4%B8%89%E6%9C%88-%E6%98%A5%E9%9B%A8%E5%A6%82%E4%B8%9D%E7%BB%87%E6%A2%A6%E6%9D%A5/plum_hu_fc0b0f5b0f3413b8.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E4%B8%89%E6%9C%88-%E6%98%A5%E9%9B%A8%E5%A6%82%E4%B8%9D%E7%BB%87%E6%A2%A6%E6%9D%A5/","title":"三月

Quantitative Research How to evaluate the service quality of a hotel? Different Objectives Qualitative\nTo uncover prevalent trends in thoughts and opinions To gain an understanding of underlying reasons and motivations To generate ideas and/or hypotheses for later quantitative research Quantitative\nTo quantify views and generalize results from a sample to the population of interest Sometimes followed by qualitative research which is used to explore some findings further Which one is better for marketing research? Quantitative Qualitative Strengths Provide data that is descriptive. Provides details about human behavior, emotion, and personality characteristics that quantitative studies cannot match. Control the influence of irrelevant variables, so as to discover the cause-and-effect relation of variables accurately. Weakness Provide no detail information for data interpretation. Less statistical power than quantitative study. Ignores the elements that can not be quantified. Differences in Method and Outcome Quantitative Qualitative Sample Usually a larger number of cases representing the population of interest. Usually a small number of non-representative cases. Random. Non-random. Data collection Survey, panel data, experiment, etc. Interview, observation, group discussion, etc. Data analysis Statistical. Non-statistical Findings Findings are usually conclusive and have good generalizability. Findings are not conclusive and cannot be used to make generalizations about the population of interest. The Marketing Research Process Define the problem and research objectives Example of a Research Brief\nAmericanAirlines (AA) is looking for new ways to serve its passengers It is reviewing many new ideas, especially to cater to its first-class passengers on very long flights, one idea was to provide an Internet connection on the flight Research objective: Whether to provide network access service during flight? How first-class passengers would respond to this service? The cost of this service? How much extra they would be willing to pay if a charge was made? Choice of first-class passenger\nWhat types of first-class passengers would respond to using an in flight Internet service?\nPrice level\nHow many first-class passengers will use the Internet service at different price levels?\nPreference of airline\nHow many extra first-class passengers might choose the Airlines because of the new service?\nPreference of WIFI service\nHow important is Internet service to first-class passengers relative to other services, such as a power plug or enhanced entertainment?\nDevelop the research plan Most commonly used research approaches in marketing\nObservation Fresh data can be gathered by observing the relevant actors and settings Consumers can be unobtrusively observed as they shop or as they consume products The Role of an observer Complete participant (going native) Part participant and part observer Complete observer Focus group Gathering 6 to 10 people carefully selected based on certain demographic, psychographic, or other considerations and brought together to discuss various topics of interest at length A professional research moderator provides questions based on the marketing managers\u0026rsquo; discussion guide or agenda In-depth Interview Open-ended, discovery-oriented method, which allows the interviewer to deeply explore the speaker\u0026rsquo;s feelings and perspectives on a subject This results in rich background information that can shape further questions relevant to the topic Types of interview Personal one-on-one interview Telephone interview Email Key Characteristics of Good In-depth Interview Open-ended Questions Questions need to be worded so that respondents talk about the topic, not just answer “yes” or “no” Seek Understanding and Interpretation It is important to use active listening skills to carefully interpret what the speaker is saying Open-minded Judgment or criticism can act as barriers to communication Flexible and Responsive Good interviewers can think on their feet, respond to challenges, and adjust their questions Patient Allow the respondent to speak freely and open up at a pace that is personally comfortable Survey Difference with interview? Companies undertake surveys to learn about people\u0026rsquo;s knowledge, beliefs, preferences, and satisfaction, and to measure these magnitudes using structured questions in the general population Usually involve a large sample size Research Approaches: Sampling issue A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population that represents a portion of the whole population There are three decisions that need to be made when designing a sample Sampling units - who or what is being surveyed Sample size - how many individuals should be surveyed Sampling procedure - how the sample should be selected Behavioral Research Customers leave traces of their purchasing behavior in store scanning data, catalog purchases, and online customer databases Advantages of behavioral data Actual purchases reflect consumers\u0026rsquo; preferences and often are more reliable than statements they offer to market researchers E.g., Customers may report preferences for popular brands, and yet the data show them actually buying other brands Technology has now advanced to such a degree that marketers can use devices such as eye-tracking, skin sensors, brain wave scanners, and full body scanners to get consumer responses Collect the information The data collection phase of marketing research is generally the most expensive and the most prone to error Professional data collection service is available Analyze the information The next-to-last step in the process is to extract findings from the collected data Various data analysis methods are available The researcher will also apply some advanced statistical techniques and decision models in the hope of discovering additional findings Present the findings The researcher presents findings relevant to the major marketing decisions facing management Make the decision The managers who commissioned the research need to weigh the evidence Good research should provide clear insights into the research problem Principles of Marketing (kotler Ch.3)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\nDescribe the environmental forces that affect the company’s ability to serve its customers Explain how changes in the demographic and economic environments affect marketing decisions Identify the major trends in the firm’s natural and technological environments Explain the key changes in the political and cultural environments Discuss how companies can react to the marketing environment Marketing environment The marketing environment includes the factors and forces outside marketing that shape opportunities and pose threats to the company.\nThe Company\u0026rsquo;s microenvironment The microenvironment consists of the factors close to the company that affect its ability to serve its customers, the company, suppliers, marketing intermediaries, customer markets, competitors, and publics.\nThe Company\nInternal environment includes:\nTop management Finance Research \u0026amp; Development Purchasing Operations Accounting Suppliers\nProvide the resources to produce goods and services Treated as partners to provide customer value Marketing Intermediaries\nHelp the company to promote, sell, and distribute its products to final buyers Resellers the distribution channel firms that help the company find customers or make sales to them.

Demographic environment is important because it involves people, and people make up markets Economic Environment Consists of factors that affect consumer purchasing power and spending patterns Consumers spend carefully during financial crisis and high inflation rate Income distribution: middle class is comfortable, but is somewhat careful in spending Natuar Environment Natural environment involves the natural resources that are needed as inputs by marketers or that are affected by marketing activities Shortages of raw materials Increased pollution Increased government intervention Environmentally sustainable strategies Green marketing Wal-Mart is committed to sustainable development by reducing its use of plastic bags and donating food that otherwise would be discarded. In response to ecological concerns, Levi Strauss and Co. designed the Levi’s© Eco 27 jeans made of 100 percent organic cotton. The product tag is made of 100 percent recycled paper. Technological Evnironment New technologies create new markets and opportunities Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is technology to track products through various points in the distribution channel Political Environment Political environment consists of laws, government agencies, and pressure groups that influence or limit various organizations and individuals in a given society\nLegislation regulating business (to protect the company, consumers and interest of society) Increased emphasis on ethics and socially responsibility action Cultural Environment The cultural environment consists of institutions and other forces that affect a society’s basic values, perceptions, and behaviors\nCore beliefs and values have a high degree of persistence, are passed on from parents to children, and are reinforced by schools, churches, businesses, and government Secondary beliefs and values are more open to change Consumer Markets and Consumer Buying behavior Learning Objectives\nDescribe the black-box model and the relationship between input and output of the model Identify the 4 major factors consumer buyer behavior\nEvaluate the 5 stages in the buyer decision process in a purchase\nWhat Influences Consumers Behavior?\nWhatis consumer behavior research? Consumer behavior is the study of how individuals, groups, and organizations, select, buy, use, and dispose of goods, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy their needs and wants Importance of Understanding Customers\nWhy? The aim of marketing is to meet and satisfy target customers’ needs and wants better than competitors What? Model of Consumer Behavior Characteristics Affecting Consumer Behavior Marketers cannot control these factors but they must take them into account Cultural Factors Cultural factors have a broad and deep influence on consumer behavior. Marketers need to understand the role played by the buyer’s\nCulture Subculture Social class Culture is the learned values, perceptions, wants, and behaviors from family and other important institutions It is the broadest influence on consumers Cultural examples: individualism V.S. collectivism\nIndividualism (independent self) Care about self Establishes a person\u0026rsquo;s personal identity based on his or her personal achievements Emphasizes personal autonomy and self - realization Focuses on the right above his or her duties Collectivism (interdependent self) Group membership is the core aspect of identity Life satisfaction comes from the successful performance of social roles and obligations Promotionandprevention focus\nIndividualism\nPromotion focus\nFocus on positive aspects For example, exercise to keep healthy and look energetic Collectivism\nPrevention focus\nAvoid negative consequences For example, exercise to avoid weight gain Subcultures are groups of people within a culture with shared value systems based on common life experiences and situations\nThey include nationalities, religions , racial groups, and geographic regions\nSocial classes are society’s relatively permanent and ordered divisions whose members share similar values, interests, and behaviors\nUpper class Middle class Working class Lower class What indicates the social class? A cluster of variables: occupation, income, wealth, education, and value orientation etc Can you move up or down the social class ladder? Depends on how rigid the social stratification is in the society Marketing Implications of Social Classes\nSocial classes show distinct product and brand preferences in many areas, including clothing, home furnishings, leisure activities, and automobiles Social classes differ in media preferences, with upper-class consumers often preferring magazines and books, and lower-class consumers often preferring television. Even within a media category such as TV, upper-class consumers tend to prefer news and drama, and lower-class consumers tend to prefer soap operas and sports programs There are also language differences among the social classes. Advertising copy and dialogue must ring true to the targeted social class Social Factors Consumers do not make purchase decision on their own. A consumer’s behavior is often influenced by social factors including\nGroups and Social Networks Membership groups of which a consumer is officially a member Reference Groups are groups that serve as a comparison point we refer to in making a purchase aspirational groups trend setters opinion leaders Online social networks are online communities where people socialize or exchange information and opinions Family Family members can strongly influence buyer behavior Buyers vs Customrs Decision-makers vs Buying influences Family—Roles and Influence of Family Members\nMarketers are interested in the roles and relative influence of family members in the purchase of a large variety of products and services These roles vary widely in different countries and social classes Given women\u0026rsquo;s increasing wealth and income generating ability, household purchasing patterns are gradually changing in Asia Thus, marketers of products traditionally purchased by men are now thinking about women’s perceptions of such products Example – Focus on Women as Car Buyers\nKorean car makers are taking women more seriously as they represent 30% of domestic sales Hyundai introduced the Sonata Elegance Special, a female-oriented version of its flagship mid-sized sedan To provide a more feminine touch to its cars, Kia Motors focused on fashionable appearances Social Roles and Status the groups, family, clubs, and organizations to which a person belongs that can define role and social status Personal Factors A buyer’s decision is often influenced by personal demographic characteristics: Age and life - cycle stage Occupation Economic situation Lifestyle Personality and self - concept People change the goods and services they buy over different age and life-cycle stage. Marketers often define their targets in terms of life cycle stage and develop appropriate products and marketing plans for each stage. Occupation affects the goods and services bought by consumers A person\u0026rsquo;s economic situation will affect product decided and purchased. Marketers of income-sensitive goods should observe trends in: Personal income Savings Interest rates Lifestyle is a person’s pattern of living as expressed in his or her psychographics measured by a consumer’s AIOs (activities, interests, and opinions) to capture information about a person’s pattern of acting and interacting in the environment Personality and Self-Concept Personality refers to the unique psychological characteristics that lead to consistent and lasting responses to the consumer’s environment MATCH brand’s personality with YOURS Self-concept refers to people’s possessions that contribute to and reflect their identities Brand personality refers to the specific mix of human traits that may be attributed to a particular brand Consumers are likely to choose brands with personalities that match their own Psychological Factors A person’s psychological factors influence his/her daily behavior as well as buying choices. The four major psychological factors are:\nMotivation Perception Learning Beliefs and attitudes Key Psychological Processes\nThe starting point for understanding consumer behavior is the stimulus-response model Marketing and environmental stimuli enter the consumer’s consciousness A set of psychological processes combine with certain consumer characteristics to result in decision processes and purchase decisions What do marketers need to understand? Psychological Factors\nMotivation\nA motive is a need that is sufficiently pressing to direct the person to seek satisfaction Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains why people are driven by particular needs at particular times Psychological Needs Safety Needs Social Needs Esteem Needs Self-actualization Motivation research refers to qualitative research designed to probe consumers’ hidden, subconscious motivations Howdomarketers uncover deeper motives triggered by a product? In-depth interviews, word association, sentence completion, picture interpretation, and role-playing Perception is the process by which people select, organize, and interpret information to form a meaningful picture of the world from three perceptual processes\nSelective attention is the tendency for people to screen out most of the information to which they are exposed Selective distortion is the tendency for people to interpret information in a way that will support what they already believe Selective retention is the tendency to remember good points made about a brand they favor and to forget good points about competing brands Selective Attention: Some Findings\nPeople are more likely to notice stimuli that relates to a current need People are more likely to notice stimuli that they anticipate You are more likely to notice computers than radios in a computer store People are more likely to notice stimuli whose deviations are large in relation to the normal size of the stimuli Selective Distortion\nEven noticed stimuli don’t always come across in the way the senders intended Selective distortion is the tendency to interpret information in a way that fits our preconceptions Consumers will often distort information to be consistent with prior brand and product beliefs and expectations Marketing implications? Selective distortion can work to the advantage of marketers with strong brands when consumers distort neutral or ambiguous brand information to make it more positive Selective Distortion: Blind Taste Test\nTwo groups of people are invited to test the same product, with one group knowing which brand it is and the other group not When consumers report different opinions of branded and unbranded versions of identical products, it must be the case that their brand and product beliefs have somehow changed their product perceptions Selective Retention\nMost consumers don’t remember much of the information to which they are exposed, but they do retain information that supports their attitudes and beliefs Because of selective retention, consumers are likely to remember good points about a product they like and forget good points about competing products Marketing implications? Use repetition in marketing Learning is the changes in an individual’s behavior arising from experience Learning theory teaches marketers that they can build demand for a product by associating it with strong drives, using motivating cues, and providing positive reinforcement Case Analysis Shift, rather than accommodate, those existing social attitudes Created demand from nothing by associating their product with strong drives (internal emotion), enhancing stimuli and cues (celebrity wearing diamonds), and providing positive reinforcement (social status \u0026amp;romance) Belief is a descriptive thought that a person has about something based on knowledge, opinion or faith Attitudes describe a person’s relatively consistent evaluations, feelings, and tendencies toward an object or idea Types of Buying Decision Behavior High-Involvement Purchase Consumers are usually highly involved when there is high perceived risk in the purchase\nexpensive risky purchases infrequently highly self-expressive High involvement purchases lead to more active, careful decision making. The buyers will go through a learning process and the development of beliefs and 61 attitudes before a thoughtful purchase choice is made Low-Involvement Purchase Low involvement purchases are made as quickly and efficiently as possible because buyers do not pass through the usual belief-attitude behavior sequence Consumers usually have little involvement in the purchase of low-price and risk-free products. Consumers do not search extensively for information about the brands, evaluate brand characteristics, and make weighty decisions about which brands to buy Types of Buying Decision Behavior Types of consumer buying behavior based on the degree of buyer effort and the degree of differences among brands Complex Buying Behavior\nConsumers undertake complex buying behavior when they are highly involved in a purchase and perceive significant differences among brands. Typically, the consumer has much to learn about the product category. Purchasers are highly motivated when product is expensive, risky, purchased infrequently and highly self-expressive Marketers of high-involvement products must understand the information-gathering and evaluation behavior of high-involvement consumers\nDissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior\nDissonance-reducing buying behavior occurs when consumers are highly involved with an expensive, infrequent, or risky purchase, but see little difference among brands Post-purchase dissonance occurs when the consumer notices certain disadvantages of the product purchased or hears favorable things about a product not purchased To counter such dissonance, the marketer\u0026rsquo;s after-sale communications should provide evidence and support to help consumers feel good about their brand choices\nHabitual Buying Behavior\nHabitual buying behavior occurs when consumers have low involvement and there is little significant brand difference As buyers are not highly committed to any brands, marketers of low-involvement products with few brand differences often use price and sales promotions to stimulate buying\nVariety-Seeking Buying Behavior\nVariety-seeking buying behavior occurs when consumers have low involvement and there are significant brand differences. Customers often do a lot of brand switching to seek for variety Consumers often do a lot of brand switching Brand switching may occur because consumers want to try another brand out of boredom or simply to try something different, rather than because of dissatisfaction Variety-seeking buying behavior Market leader should try to encourage habitual buying by offering variety \u0026amp; running frequent reminder advertising Market challenger should encourage variety seeking by offering new variety, free samples or promotion The Buyer Decision Process Need Recognition Need recognition occurs when the buyer recognizes a problem or need triggered by:\nInternal stimuli External stimuli Information Search Information search is the amount of information needed in the buying process and depends on: The strength of the drive The amount of information you start with The ease of obtaining the information The value placed on the additional information The satisfaction from searching Commercial sources inform the buyer Personal sources evaluate products for the buyer Evaluation of Alternatives How the consumer processes information to arrive at brand choices Example of Attributes in Consumer Evaluation\nSharp’s Healsio, a steam oven, reduces the fat and salt in food while keeping its vitamin C. Sharp found that mothers with small children and elders with health needs were willing to spend more money to benefit from the added values of new products that would improve their health. However, in other parts of Asia, the concern is still more on price than product benefits. In North America and Europe, Healsio’s benefits are not so much its health qualities, but rather its convenience. It can double as a microwave oven, defroster, steamer, and grill. Evaluation of Alternatives: Beliefs and Attitudes\nThrough experience and learning, people acquire beliefs and attitudes, which in turn influence buying behavior Belief—a descriptive thought that a person holds about something Attitude—a person’s enduring favorable or unfavorable evaluation, emotional feeling, and action tendencies toward some object or idea Attitudes put people into a frame of mind: liking or disliking an object, moving toward or away from it Attitudes lead people to behave in a fairly consistent way toward similar objects Is attitude easy to change? Because attitudes economize on energy and thought, they can be very difficult to change A company is well-advised to fit its product into existing attitudes rather than to try to change attitudes Beliefs and Attitudes: Expectancy-Value Model\nThe consumer arrives at attitudes toward various brands through an attribute evaluation procedure, developing a set of beliefs about where each brand stands on each attribute Purchase Decision The purchase decision is the act by the consumer to buy the most preferred brand\nTwo factors can come between the purchase intention and the purchase decision Attitudes of others Unexpected situational factors Post-Purchase Decision The post-purchase decision is the satisfaction or dissatisfaction the consumer feels about the purchase. If the product falls short of expectations, the consumer is disappointed; if it meets expectations, the consumer is satisfied The larger the gap between expectation and performance, the greater the consumer’s dissatisfaction Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort caused by a post purchase conflict. Consumers may satisfy with the benefits of their choice, but also feel uneasy about losing the benefits of the brands not purchased Customer satisfaction is a key to building profitable relationships with consumers—to keeping and growing consumers and reaping their customer lifetime value Lecture Review ","date":"2025-03-11T11:34:12+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E8%90%A5%E9%94%80%E5%AD%A6-1/%E5%B0%81%E9%9D%A2_hu_38446184ce5f077b.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E8%90%A5%E9%94%80%E5%AD%A6-1/","title":"市场营销学 1"},{"content":"Introduction Understand how to represent business processes using the entity-relationship model Implement a database design using MySQL workbench Learn to query a database using SQL Understand new trends and technologies for database Why database?

The primary purpose of a DBMS is to provide a systematic method of creating, updating, storing, and retrieving the data stored in a database. A software package that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to the database. Database System: a computerized record-keeping system, containing database and DBMS as well as some other components (e.g., hardware) Advantages of database approach Reduce but not eliminate redundancy all data items are integrated with a minimum amount of duplication Sharing of data the database is owned and accessed by the entire organization Data consistency management system reduces the risk of inconsistencies occurring Improved data accessibility due to data integration and query languages like SQL Specific steps Requirements Analysis Collect and analyze the business requirements Conceptual Design Design a conceptual model, e.g., ER model Logical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization Database Building (Physical Design) Build the database and write application programs Operation, Maintenance, \u0026amp; Tuning Use, maintain, and “tune” the database A good business rule Declarative – what, not how Precise – clear, agreed-upon meaning Atomic – one statement Consistent – internally and externally Expressible – structured, natural language Distinct – non-redundant Business-oriented – understood by business people Data definitions Explanation of a term or fact Term—word or phrase with specific meaning Fact—association between two or more terms Examples of facts: A course is a module of instruction in a particular subject area.

The E-R model is expressed in terms of entities in the business environment, the relationships (or associations) among those entities, and the attributes (or properties) of both the entities and their relationships. An E-R model is normally expressed as an entity-relationship diagram (e-r diagram, or erD), which is a graphical Why E-R model?\nA crucial tool for understanding and communicating complex data structures to both technical and non-technical stakeholders It helps to build a well-organized and efficient database! Entities Requirements: Employees are assigned to projects. For employees we record their employee ID, first name, and last name. For each project we record a project ID and project description. One project must have at least one employee, one employee can be assigned to at most one project. Entities represent real-world objects; things which can be named: Entity type: collection of entities, e.g. employee, customer, sale (often corresponds to a table) Entity” is usually used for “Entity type” Entity instance: person, place, object, event, concept SHOULD BE:\nAn object that will have many instances in the database An object that will be composed of multiple attributes An object that we are trying to model SHOULD NOT BE:\nA user of the database system An output of the database system (e.g., a report) Relationship Description: Relationship type is a set of associations among entity types Each relationship is described by a name Example: Customer Product Customers Buys Product Product is_Purchased_by Customer \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo; is usually used for \u0026ldquo;relationship type\u0026rdquo; Symbol: Straight line labeled with the name Cardinality Cardinality Constraints 基数约束 the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity Minimum cardinality If zero, then optional If one or more, then mandatory 强制的 Maximum cardinality The maximum number: one or many Why Cardinality?\nData integrity and constraint enforcement Database and query efficiency Scalability Maximum cardinality One-to-One (1:1) Each entity instance in the relationship will have a maximum of one related entity instance e.g., each student has a student account One-to-Many (1:M) An entity instance on one side of the relationship can have many (more than one) related entity instances, but an entity instance on the other side will have a maximum of one (at most one) related entity instance e.g., each department has many instructors Many-to-Many (M:M) Entity instances on both sides of the relationship can have many related entity instances on the other side e.g., many students take many courses Attribute Description Property or characteristic of an entity type (often corresponds to a field in a table) they will be used for actual communication about the real - world phenomena represented by entities and relationships Symbol: Text inside the associated entity rectangle Classifications of attributes Required versus Optional Attributes Simple versus Composite Attributes An attribute broken into component parts Composite key attribute Single-Valued { } ersus Multivalued Attribute [ ] Stored versus Derived Attributes 存储属性与派生属性 Identifier Attributes Keys Identifier 标识符 An attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies individual instances of an entity type Will not change in value Will not be null No intelligent identifiers (e.g., containing locations or people that might change) Substitute new, simple keys for long, composite keys Candidate key 候选键 All available unique, required identifiers to an entity Primary key 主键 The best one among the candidate key ER Modeling Part 2 Modeling relationship Relationship Types vs. Relationship Instances The relationship type is modeled as lines between entity types The relationship instance is between specific entity instances Two entities can have more than one type of relationship between them (multiple relationships) Degree of relationships: the number of entity types that participate in it Relationships can have attributes Associative Entity – combination of relationship and entity Degree of relationships Degree of a relationship is the number of entity types that participate in it Unary relationship Binary relationship Ternary relationship Attributes on relationships Attributes\nCan be associated with entities Can also be assigned to relationships A binary relationship with an attribute\nHere, the date completed attribute pertains specifically to the employee’s completion of a course It is an attribute of the relationship An associative entity\nAssociative entity is like a relationship with an attribute, but it is also considered to be an entity in its own right Note that the many-to-many cardinality between entities has been replaced by two one-to-many relationships with the associative entity Associative entities\nWhen should we use an Associative Entity? All relationships for the associative entity should be many. The associative entity could have meanings independent of the other entities. The associative entity preferably has a unique identifier, and should also have other attributes. The associative entity may participate in other relationships other than the entities of the associated relationship. Supertypes and subtypes Why Super and Subtypes?\nAvoids redundant data\nSupports specialization and generalization\nImproves query efficiency\nA query for all employees can be performed on the employee table, without needing to check each subtype separately Allows for flexible business rules\nE.g., Assistant \u0026amp; Skill Define a subtype (specialization) when:\nThe subtype has additional attributes of interest (e.g., billing rate is recorded for consultants only) and/or The subtype participants in additional relationships Enhanced ER model\nExtends original ER model with new modeling constructs Subtype\nA subgrouping of the entities in an entity type that has attributes distinct from those in other subgrouping Supertype\nA generic entity type that has a relationship with one or more subtypes Attribute inheritance\nSubtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype Attribute inheritance An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype e.g., if ‘Michael’ is in subtype Manager, the data object is also in supertype Employee Subtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype possesses subtype-specific attributes Relationships and subtypes Relationships at the supertype level indicate that ALL subtypes will participate in the relationship The instances of a subtype may participate in a relationship UNIQUE to that subtype. In this situation, the relationship is shown at the subtype level Specialization process Specialization: the process of maximizing the differences between members of an entity by identifying their distinguishing characteristics Specialization is a top-down approach to: Defining a set of supertypes Defining a subtype when It has additional attributes of interest It participates in additional relationships Generalization process Generalization is the reverse of the specialization process 泛化是特化过程的反向操作 Generalization: the process of minimizing the differences between entities by identifying their common characteristics (common attributes and relationships) Generalization is a bottom-up approach to identifying several entities identifying a generalized supertype from these entities Strong vs. Weak entities Strong entities exist independently of other types of entities has its own unique identifier represented with single-line rectangle Weak entities dependent on a strong entity\u0026hellip;cannot exist on its own does not have a unique identifier represented with double-line rectangle Identifying relationship links strong entities to weak entities represented with double line Assignment 1 Exercise 1 3C is a consulting company in Newark. It needs a database to keep track of the assignment of employees to projects. For each employee, 3C wants to record an employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday. For each project, 3C wants to record a project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date. Employees are included in the database even when they have not been assigned to any project. A project must have at least one employee assigned. An employee’s billing rate (the price they charge client for their services) may vary by projects, and 3C wishes to record the applicable billing rate for each employee when assigned to different projects (Hint: Add relationship attributes).\n对于每位employee，3C希望记录 employee ID (unique for every employee), name, address, and birthday 对于每个Project，3C希望记录project ID (unique for each project), project name, and start date 即使员工尚未被分配到任何项目，也会将其纳入数据库 一个项目必须至少分配一名员工 员工的计费费率 employee\u0026rsquo;s billing rate（他们为其服务向客户收取的价格）可能因项目而异 3C 希望记录每个员工在被分配到不同项目时的适用计费费率 Exercise 2 A restaurant is looking to enhance its inventory tracking and optimize sales. One crucial aspect of this system is the relationship between orders and products. Each order has OrderID and Date. Each Product has Product ID and Product Name. The information about a product can be recorded before it is included in any order. The same product can be part of multiple orders. Additionally, some products are composed of multiple other products (e.g., Big Mac Value Meal).\nProduct Big Mac (ProductID: 1003) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 4806 Sesame Seed Bun 1 each 5890 10:1 Patty 2 each 6515 Cheese 2 slice 9875 Dehydrated Onions 1 oz 4050 Lettuce 2 oz 7432 Special Sauce 2 Tbsp 5315 Salt 0.5 Tsp Small Fries (ProductID: 143) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 5315 Salt 0.25 Tsp 7499 Potato 10 oz Small Diet Coke (ProductID: 2499) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1978 Diet Coke Syrup 0.5 Tsp 1277 Water 12 oz Happy Meal (ProductID: 9444) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 522 Cheeseburger 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 small 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each Big Mac Value Meal (ProductID: 2911) ProductID Ingredient Quantity Unit 1003 Big Mac 1 each 143 Small Fries 1 each 2499 Small Diet Coke 1 each 每个 Order 都有 OrderID \u0026amp; Date 每个 Product 都有 Product ID \u0026amp; Product Name 产品信息可在其被纳入任何订单之前记录 部分产品由多个其他产品组成 Exercise 3 The 3C company would like to record the information about its employees (either fulltime or part-time) in an enterprise information system. For all employees, they record SSN (unique for each employee), name, address, date-of-birth and degree. They record the salary and date hired for fulltime employees only. Further, the bonus of all managers (who are fulltime employees) has to be recorded. Bonus is not recorded for other fulltime employees (e.g., engineers); for managers only. 3C also records hourly wage for part-time employees. 3C would like to record additional information for interns and custodians (both part-time employees). For interns, the number of hours per week and the manager they work for need to be recorded. An intern is assigned to at least one manager. If an intern works for more than one manager, 3C needs to record how many hours (a week) the intern works for each manager. Not all managers have interns. A few managers have more than one intern. For custodians the shift time need to be recorded.\n所有员工：记录社会安全号码（SSN，每位员工唯一）、姓名、地址、出生日期和学位 全职员工：除上述信息外，还记录工资和雇佣日期。其中，经理（属于全职员工）需额外记录奖金，其他全职员工（如工程师）不记录奖金 兼职员工：记录小时工资。对于实习生和管理员这两类兼职员工，还需记录额外信息 实习生：记录每周工作小时数，以及为之工作的经理。实习生至少被分配给一位经理，若为多位经理工作，需记录为每位经理工作的每周时长。并非所有经理都有实习生，部分经理有多名实习生 管理员：记录轮班时间 Exercise 4 An international school of technology has hired you to create a database management system to assist in scheduling classes. After several interviews with the president, you have come up with the following list of entities, attributes, and initial business rules:\nRoom is identified by BID and Room No and also has a Capacity. A room can be either a lab or a classroom. If it is a classroom, it has an additional attribute called Board Type. Media is identified by MID and has attributes of Media Type and Type Description. Note: Here we are tracking type of media (such as a VCR, projector, etc.), not the individual piece of equipment. Tracking of equipment is outside of the scope of this project. Computer is identified by CID and has attributes Computer Type, Type Description, Disk Capacity, and Processor Speed. Please note: As with Media Type, we are tracking only the type of computer, not an individual computer. You can think of this as a class of computers (e.g., Core™ i7 2.6GHz) Instructor has identifier EID and has attributes Name, Rank, and Office Phone. Course has identifier CourseID (e.g., MIS804) and has attributes Course Description and Credits. Courses can have one, none, or many prerequisites. Courses also have one or more sections. Section has attributes SecID (e.g., 010), Semester, Year, and Enrollment Limit. After some further discussions, you have come up with some additional business rules to help you create the initial design:\nAn instructor teaches one, none, or many sections of a course in a given semester. A room can be scheduled for many sections or no section in a given semester of a given year. However, one section can only be scheduled in one room. A room can have one type of media, several types of media, or no media. Instructors are trained to use one, none, or many types of media. A lab has one or more computer types. However, a classroom does not have any computers. A room cannot be both a classroom and a lab. There also are no other room types to be incorporated into the system. Room: BID \u0026amp; Room No, Capacity lab classroom: Board Type Media: MID, Media Type, Type Description Computer: CID, Computer Type, Type Description, Disk Capacity, Processor Speed Instructor: EID, Name, Rank, and Office Phone Course: CourseID, Course Description, Credits Section: SecID, Semester, Year, and Enrollment Limit Translating ER Model into Relational Model Logical Design How to connect multiple entities?\nHow to ensure data integrity?\nLogical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization What is logical design?\nLogical database design is about creating stable database structures— correctly expressing the requirements in a technical language. Conceptual data modeling is about understanding the organization—getting the requirements right They show how data is connected and how changes to one area of the system can impact other areas helps ensure data integrity, as it provides a way to ensure data is consistent and accurate across the system We focus on the relational data model based on mathematical theory and therefore has a solid theoretical foundation Relation Definition: A relation is a named, two-dimensional table of data Table consists of rows (records), and columns (attribute or field) Relations (tables) correspond with entity types实体类型 and with relationships types关系类型 Rows correspond with entity instances and with relationship instances Columns correspond with attributes Note: The word relation (in relational database) is NOT the same as the word relationship (in E-R model) Relational Model Step 1: Strong entity and attributes\nStep 2: Binary relationships\nStep 2.1: One-to-many relationships FK on the M-side Primary key on the one side becomes a foreign key on the many side No null value in the foreign key \u0026mdash; this is because of the mandatory minimum cardinality Step 2.2: One-to-one relationships FK on the optional side Step 2.3: Many-to-Many relationships Add a new relation (with PFKs) Step 3: Weak entity\nA separate relation with a foreign key taken from the strong entity A new relation with FK from the strong entity as part of its PK (PFK) Step 4: Unary/recursive relationships 一元/递归关系\nOne-to-many -\u0026gt; one relation with FK\nMany-to-many -\u0026gt; add a new relation (with PFKs)\nStep 5: Multi-valued attributes 多值属性\nMultivalued attribute becomes a separate relation with foreign key A new relation with PFK Step 6: Supertypes and subtypes\nOne relation for supertype and for each subtype Supertype attributes go into supertype relation Subtype attributes go into each subtype; primary key of supertype relation also becomes primary key of subtype relation 1:1 relationship established between supertype and each subtype, with supertype as primary table PFK in each subtype Integrity Constraints Entity Integrity No primary key attribute may be null. All primary key fields MUST have data Referential Integrity Any foreign key value MUST match a primary key value (or the foreign key can be null) e.g. Delete Rules Restrict – don’t allow delete of “customer” side if related rows exist in “order” side Cascade – automatically delete “order” side rows that correspond with the “customer” side row to be deleted Set-to-Null – set the foreign key in the dependent side to null if deleting from the “customer” side → not allowed for weak entities Many-to-many(M:N) Highlights Always adding another relation (table/associative entity) to convert a M:N relationship to two 1:M relationships MySQL workbench will automatically generate a new table if you choose M:N relationship between two tables! Be careful about the changes in Cardinalities M:N -\u0026gt; 1:M The minimum cardinalities need to be adjusted accordingly – Swap Identifying vs Non-identifying relationship Identifying relationship - where the child entity\u0026rsquo;s identity/existence relies solely on the parent entity. No parent entity means no child entity For an identifying relationship, you put the primary key column from the parent into the primary key column of the child (along with other columns needed to provide uniqueness) For a non-identifying relationship, you put the primary key column of the parent into the table of the child, but not in the primary key Tutorial File → new model 外观设置 Model → Model Options → Diagram → 不勾选 Show Column Types → 勾选 Show Captions Model → Object Notation → 勾选 ID1F1X Model → Relationship Notation → 勾选 Crow\u0026rsquo;s Foot (IE) Normalization Logical Design Translate the ER model into the relational model Normalization Normalization in database design Normalization Process for evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize data redundancies and ensure data integrity Works through a series of stages called normal forms Normal form Second normal form Third normal form 2 NF is better than 1 NF; 3 NF is better than 2 NF For most business database design purpose, 3 NF is the highest we need to go in the normalization process Highest level of normalization is not always most desirable Different normal forms Conversion to first normal form First Normal Form (1NF) Each row has a PK value Every column should have single values No repeating groups (columns) Anomalies 异常 Anomalies are issues caused by redundant data Insertion annomalies Modification anomalies Deletion anomalies Functional dependency (FD) 函数依赖\nThe value of one attribute (the determinant: e.g., A ) determines the value of another attribute (e.g., B) (denoted A -\u0026gt; B)\nWe should identify functional dependencies that hold for all possible values relation NF Problem – Partial dependencies\n1 NF tables are still subject to data redundancies -\u0026gt; anomalies Partial dependencies: Only part of the PK can determine some non-primary key attributes some non-primary key attributes are functionally dependent on only part of the PK Transformation between normal forms Convert 1NF to 2NF Second Normal Form (2NF): every non-PK attribute is fully functionally dependent on the PK\nA relation with a single attribute PK is automatically in 2 NF Step1: Identify all dependencies\nFDs (from business rules): courseNo, sectionNo → title, units, deptCode, instructorID, fName, lName courseNo → title, units, deptCode instructorID → fName, lName FD diagram Depicts all dependencies found within a given table structure Helpful in getting bird’s-eye view of all relationships among a table’s attributes Step2: Remove partial dependency\nWrite the determinant of the partial dependency the key of a new relation Place the dependent attributes on a separate line as in the partial dependency in the new relation along with their determinant Keep the rest of the original relation Convert 2NF to 3NF A table is in third normal form (3NF) if: It is in 2NF and no non-PK attribute is transitively dependent on the PK Step 1: Identify transitive dependencies For every transitive dependency, write its determinant Step 2: Remove transitive dependencies as a PK for a new table Place the dependent attributes in the transitive dependency in the new table identified in step1 Keep the rest of the other tables Normalization and database design Normalization should be part of the design process\nMake sure that proposed entities meet required normal form before table structures are created\nMany real-world databases have been improperly designed or burdened with anomalies if improperly modified during course of time\nYou may be asked to redesign and modify existing databases\nE-R diagram\nProvides the big picture, or macro view, of an organization’s data requirements and operations Created through an iterative process\nIdentifying relevant entities, their attributes and their relationship Use results to identify additional entities and attributes Normalization procedures\nFocus on the characteristics of specific entities A micro view of the entities within the ER diagram Difficult to separate normalization process from ER modeling process\nTwo techniques should be used concurrently\nSummary Normalization is a table design technique aimed at minimizing data redundancies First three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) are most commonly encountered Normalization is an important part—but only a part—of the design process Continue the iterative ER process until all entities and their attributes are defined and all equivalent tables are in 3NF Assignment 2 Exercise 1 Logical Data Model Exercise 2 Logical Data Model Exercise 3 Logical Data Model Exercise 4 Logical Data Model ","date":"2025-03-10T15:56:56+08:00","image":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/title_hu_e240d0350799f182.jpg","permalink":"https://majiao2.github.io/2025/%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/","title":"实体关系建模"},{"content":"Networking Fundamentals Network \u0026amp;

LOGIN\nThe username and password are encoded in Base64 and transmitted one by one, first the username and then the password. CRAM - MD5\nThe server requests the client to solve a computational challenge using the password. The client\u0026rsquo;s response is a string containing a username and a 16 - byte digest in hexadecimal notation. This string is BASE64 - encoded. Mail message format SMTP [RFC 821]: protocol for exchanging email message\nRFC 822: standard for text message\nheader lines\nTo: From: Subject: different from SMTP commands\nbody\nthe \u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;, ASCII characters only MIME: multimedia mail extension, RFC 2045, 2056\nadditional lines in message header declare MIME content type Scenario: Alice sends message to Bob Alice uses her User Agent (UA) to compose a message and sets the \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; field as \u0026ldquo;bob@someschool.edu \u0026rdquo;. Alice\u0026rsquo;s UA sends the message to her mail server, and the message is placed in the message queue. The client - side of SMTP opens a TCP connection with Bob\u0026rsquo;s mail server. User Agent - Mail Server The SMTP client sends Alice\u0026rsquo;s message over the TCP connection. Bob\u0026rsquo;s mail server places the message in Bob\u0026rsquo;s mailbox. Bob invokes his User Agent to read the message. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) deliver and store emails to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s server. Email Access Protocols: retrieval from server POP (Post Office Protocol, based on RFC 1939 standard) authorization process between the user agent and the server to achieve the function of downloading emails. IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol, based on RFC 1730 standard) more features (more complex). manipulation of stored msgs on server HTTP Hotmail, Yahoo!Mail POP3 \u0026ldquo;download and delete\u0026rdquo; mode You cannot re-read e mail if you changes client \u0026ldquo;download-and keep\u0026rdquo; mode copies of messages on different clients POP3 is stateless across sessions IMAP Keep all messages in one place: the server. Allow users to organize messages in folders. IMAP maintains the user state across sessions: names of folders and the mappings between message IDs and folders. Application Layer Protocols - HTTP Web and HTTP First, some jargon:\nA web page consists of objects. An object can be an HTML file, a JPEG image, a Java applet, an audio file, etc. A web page consists of a base HTML file which includes several referenced objects. Each object is addressable by a URL. Example URL: HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol\nWeb’s application layer protocol\nclient/server model\nclient: browser that requests, receives, \u0026ldquo;displays\u0026rdquo; Web objects server: Web server sends objects in response to requests HTTP 1.0: RFC 1945\nHTTP 1.1: RFC 2068\nHTTP request message two types of HTTP messages: request, response HTTP request message: ASCII (human-readable format) general format Method types HTTP/1.1 GET POST HEAD PUT uploads file in entity body to path specified in URL field DELETE asks server to leave requested object out of response deletes file specified in the URL field HTTP/1.0 GET, POST, HEAD Uploading from input Post method: Web page often includes form input Input is uploaded to server in entity body URL method: Uses GET method Input is uploaded in URL field of request line HTTP response message In first line in server-\u0026gt;client response message. A few sample codes: 200 OK request succeeded, requested object later in this message 301 Moved Permanently requested object moved, new location specified later in this message (Location:) 400 Bad Request request message not understood by server 404 Not Found requested document not found on this server 505 HTTP Version Not Supported HTTP/2 HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015. HTTP/2 allows the server to \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; content, that is, to respond with data for more queries than the client requested. Multiplexing of requests, header compression, and prioritization of request.

These are used by popular applications. Servers/daemons usually use well-known ports. Any client can identify the server/service. Registered port numbers (1024 to 49152) used for less central applications. http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers Ephemeral port numbers: 49153 to 65535 Clients usually use dynamic ports. Assigned by the client kernel at run time.
